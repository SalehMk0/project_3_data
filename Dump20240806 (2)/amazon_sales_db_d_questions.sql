It comes with many cards and lots to test and play with. It is what I use it for as you can do 40 card decks if you want mono colours or for doubles do 40 or 60 card decks. However, the set comes with two cards at max of any card unless you are lucky. Thus, when playing with others whom collect you will loose as any deck made from this set is very luck based. Especially when they have four of some cards in their deck. I love just mixing cards and testing small strategies with this deck and it does add some good core cards to any collection.
