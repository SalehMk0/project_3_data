Of course, that doesn\'t match with steam train (a few decades out!); but this being a beginners train set that won\'t matter most young children (just be careful if your recipient is very clued up on these things!). The crane is weighted so it won\'t tip over when used to lift derailled trucks and wagons.  Add on winders are plugged in to operate the hook and crane height. Excellent pulley mechanism for raising the crane arm.The train has a plain colour scheme, like a general shunting train, as if it were one of many of the same kind. Almost gave it 4 stars because of this, but it\'s low priced so it stays at 5.The controller, track, wagon are all the usual good Hornby quality.Excellent small starter trainset, especially if you want to do more than just watch a train go round and round..... | Great set',5,107,'2015-04-16'),(72,'1e9876e6f7e98a6bb869341b4b56efd5',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(73,'7370f538e03a2b5c543d9ab551c41385',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(74,'326e553d0be9fdde19a4eba2ee356764',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(75,'7ac9dab2688ccf3cc7c8841b00e6c828',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(76,'65946ec2a36d8c4c7dc4f324ec27d6cf',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(77,'d00536420b49a24024d1478353930c08',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(78,'ffa7ca3452b7fba9bd7d2205a6401e77',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(79,'cda61b59b03b1bb38557774b5f0e6e39',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(80,'194f1b693807e89a41dbe61ef6cbb55c',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(81,'c2f2229faa77de1279f2f72649ae3bb4',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(82,'21ac3b927d42e0ca97da1384e6221b50',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(83,'cea1292c07ce1d353f3a9d0d89086ee2',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(84,'9eab0ff60b4865bc7a90a7d8770b88cf','... received this lovely train today and I am really happy with this purchase // 5.0 // 24 Oct. 2015 // By\n    \n    Scurry\n  \n on 24 Oct. 2015 // I received this lovely train today and I am really happy with this purchase.

This is not so, you have to continually press the horn of each chugger and then they will interact and comment on what is around them i.e tunnell, chugwash etc....This is ok for older children who have grasped the idea and know what to do. But for younger children it reverts to a push along train and in effect is no different from the die-cast edition.

I think the finish is very good although it is a static model eg. the wheels etc. do not rotate and it is fixed to its stand which is effectively a short length of track. The real locomotive is preserved by the North Yorks Moors Railway and this replica certainly does justice to it.The model is supplied in an outer sleeve which protects a clear plastic case, in the case of my model it also has a removable thin plastic film over part of it as an additional protection. At the price you couldn\'t really ask for more, and, if like me, you are short of space, the 1:120 scale is ideal.

The teddies were in plastic bags (good idea while in a warehouse), so I had to find more suitable packaging (boxes) for presentation.I\'m trusting Steiff to have produced something that\'s robust (my 29 year old still has his, which he was given at 1 year old), rather than just a collectors item - hence the 5 stars for durability.

They are in the traditional black on white, or white on black style and come in 30 to a pack which makes them very good value for money. These will be perfect for any specific dice games, as well as replacing lost dice from any board games you may have. They could also be used as an inexpensive way of teaching kids about numbers and probability in schools.

You can play it two ways. Civilised and with everyone taking a turn, or more as the game suggests, shaking the dice and grabbing for the card you want so you can collect you card sets before anyone else. But be warned, if you pick up a card with a corresponding dice that chimes ... you can\'t have it. If you play the second version make sure you\'ve got plenty of room and there are no breakables within the immediate area. Especially if over enthusiastic children are playing!  Really good fun.

A player rolls the dice and then has the opportunity to roll each dice again up to three times with the objective of making the highest scoring word. Each player takes a turn, and the scores are totted up. Play resumes back with the first player until a player reaches a pre-decided winning total.The way the scoring system works is quite clever too, in that there is a compromise between the length of the word and complexity of it, as each letter has a different score associated with it. To score the turn, the number of letters in the word is multiplied by the score of each of those letters (the tube includes a multiplication table to ease you through this).This is a rewarding game where the chance element is large enough to bridge gaps between different intelligence levels, but an enjoyable experience for all. I would recommend this as a family activity, or for out and about, as it takes up almost no space. | Letter Dice // 5.0 // 22 Aug. 2010 // By\n    \n    Kindle Customer\n  \n on 22 Aug. 2010 // This is a really useful toy, if you\'re a teacher.I\'ve been playing with the dice almost every day while I work with my SEN dyslexic child.

It\'s great for 2 players or more.  After playing it a few times, we settled on 4 minutes per person which is just enough to put the pressure on and keep the game moving between players.  Owing to its size and weight, its ideal to take on holiday for couples or families.  Beware though, you may need a dictionary to resolve disagreements in spelling! | You Can Play The Dice Too // 5.0 // 6 Jan. 2011 // By\n    \n    Simon Jepps\n  \n on 6 Jan. 2011 // This game is fantastic. I\'d been trying to invent a tactical, strategic game myself that just uses dice. I had thought about lettered dice also, but this guy just seems to have hit the nail on the head. It\'s very good.I was playing it last night and invented a patience version whereby you can actually play/challenge the dice.Basically you play as usual, but when it comes to the \"dice\'s turn\" you roll all 9 dice, then remove the vowels leaving just the consonants. You must remove at least 3 vowels. If you could only remove 2 max, then roll the remaining consonants again to produce more vowels to remove. The Dice similarly have 3 rolls max per turn but only if required. If after 1 or 2 rolls the minimum 3 vowels have been removed you then stop rolling. If after 3 rolls you have still only managed to remove 2 vowels max then that is just hard luck. You then add up the word value of the consonants as you would a real word, then multiply by how many consonants, again as you would a real word.? = vowel but Y does not. | Simple but brilliant // 5.0 // 20 Nov. 2009 // By\n    \n    V. Tapp\n  \n on 20 Nov. 2009 // Like many of the best ideas, Dicewords is very simple and the rules can be learned in a couple of minutes.  It has elements of Scrabble and Boggle (and no doubt other word games) but at the same time has its own unique character. It\'s extremely flexible: it can be played anywhere, with any number of people, for any length of time, and with any level of skill. It can be enjoyed by everyone - from the 6-year-old who can spell a couple of dozen words to the hardened Scrabble fanatic. However, what I personally enjoy most about it is the collaborative element. While Scrabble tends to generate long silences as players struggle with impossible letter combinations, and Boggle creates frantic mayhem while everyone races each other to get the most words, Dicewords invariably seems to encourage co-operation between players. Although each player has their own turn with their own letters, everyone else can watch them put a word together and this often ends up as a group activity. Most of my best words have been made with other people\'s letters! This does, of course, mean that winning the game is a rather random affair, but it\'s a great deal more fun than sitting silently for an hour or so. For this reason, it works well as a party game and is a great icebreaker if you have friends who don\'t know each other well. Of course, it can also be played in a deadly serious and competitive fashion, if that\'s what you want. Anyone who enjoys word games will love this, and I can imagine it would work very well in an educational environment too. | dice words // 5.0 // 22 Nov. 2009 // By\n    \n    Andrew Hiddleston\n  \n on 22 Nov. 2009 // bought this for second time for a friend it is so addictive and durable educational with out being to complicated | Handy Travel Size game',5,1710,'2011-05-25'),(471,'8d3ebf06b48bbf1f5d9a10f5a095e3c7','Five Stars',5,121,'2016-04-03'),(472,'b5b9d9641ddd0c677c5ddaa719207f63',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(473,'f35d1223e5dda585b09fa5997d33191e',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(474,'ac4e4125d4c98cd7412d213ea1d33650','Finally!

The aim of these are for the children to roll them and put them in order to make a sequence ready for a story. The child is then to use their imagination to create a story based on those characters, props and themes.Medic includes images of: wheelchair, person with a mask on, stethoscope, spotty sad face, needle, plasters, fan, sad face, broken bone etc.Uses: These are a fantastic resource to use in the classroom or at home. They come in a variety of styles which will suit different topics and children\'s interests. In the classroom they can be used individually with children or they could be used as a whole group with each child having a different image to add to the whole class story (e.g. sit in a circle and try to add a sequence to the running story). At home, or in the car journey they can be used to keep children amused and stimulated throughout.They are:> Compact, lightweight and durable.> Come in a lovely presentation box to keep them safe!> Have a different image on each face e.g a character, prop or themes/ideas.> Have a variety of themes to choose from e.g. other imagination ones and a new batman one has just been released.Would highly recommend to anyone who has children or works with them!

The set I received included yellow counters. The plastic tube is quite robust and the whole thing is no bigger than a tube of smarties. Each of the three dice have 1 side with an L, 1 with a C, 1 with an R and 3 with a single dot.The game is very simple. You start with three counters for each player and throw the three dice in turn. The letters are the direction in which you must pass a \'coin\', to the person on your left or right and C going to the \'bank\' in the centre. But where you throw a dot, you get to keep that number of coins.When your next turn arrives, if you have three or more coins then you throw all three dice, if you have two coins then you only throw two dice, or indeed one if you have only one coin left. The game continues until only one person is left with any coins and they then win all the banked coins.Jackpot!Instructions are included but if you\'ve read this far, you already know exactly how to play!We were introduced to this game whilst visiting family on holiday in Ireland and we played with three 5 (euro) cent coins each. My 5 and 7 year olds were facinated by it and wanted to keep playing. The great thing is the game doesn\'t last too long - with 6 people, about 10 minutes per game. We played three games before the kids bedtime and it was just enough for us all.The gameplay is engaging and crucially you get to communicate and have a good laugh together. It\'s a great way of enjoying the company of others.It\'s a really inexpensive game and slips into your pocket or hand luggage if you\'re travelling. A good all-round buy and highly recommended! | simple concept prooves good fun for all ages // 5.0 // 14 Feb. 2011 // By\n    \n    Ms. K. A. Young\n  \n on 14 Feb. 2011 // This is so simple yet it has the excitement of \"GAMBLING\"! We play it starting with 10 pennies each. We don\'t put out the player with no pennies, we let them wait in, not throwing the dice, but they\'ll get a penny passed from left or right eventually - and might win in the end! Age range in our game = 5/6 years to 84. Age 5 learnt left from right. I recommend it to get a group like this to laugh together. | No idea why this is reviewed so highly! // 1.0 // 5 Feb. 2016 // By\n    \n    Ali\n  \n on 5 Feb. 2016 // Bought as a stocking filler for my 4 and 7 year old and am very disappointed!The game is cheap enough and I bought it on the back of reading such positive reviews.I\'m not sure if its that my kids enjoy games ranging from pairs and top trumps to rumikub, qwixx, sequence and yatzee but this game is beyond boring! There is no skill involved and my kids (who have good attention spans) were uninterested after the first game we played.Only positive I found was that it encourages kids to learn left and right.Not sure what I\'m missing! | Brilliant family game..... // 5.0 // 20 Jun. 2014 // By\n    \n    J.

It is a good concept and he could play it with his sisters of 5 and 7 without too much fighting. The idea is that you collect beads by throwing a coloured dice (or die if you\'re pedantic!) and stack them in the correct order on posts. However several of the beads would not fit on the posts until we did some judicious sanding- while the 3 year old waited impatiently clutching a red bead- and although the instructions said to \"store the beads in the box lid so everyone could reach\" the packaging does not include a lid but is similar to a cereal box. The beads come in a small plastic bag and roll off of the table at frequent intervals. What should have been a fun game from the start was let down by the quality of the materials and packaging.

(Our Lego fan was given her calendar early due to illness and adult incompetence.)~ Stephanie - blonde - this is a nice figure - lilac cardigan/jacket - pale blue skirt and scarf - white leggings - dark grey boots - nice printing over front torso.~ Lily - 1st appearance in a Lego Friends build - black hair tied in a pony tail - red skirt and leggings (which were also in last year\'s Friends Advent calendar) - black boots - white jumper with a red reindeer pattern on it. The Lily figure is very nice, but the recipient thought it was just an Emma variation until we pointed out that it had different hair (Emma having loose flowing black hair and Lily having black hair in a ponytail) so we have decided that Lily must be Emma\'s sister..Some of the builds are all right and others are ... well it took several of us to try and decide what they were supposed to be (not in any particular order):- Christmas tree- snowman - light purple hat and orange/red scarf, comes with a yard brush.

Harrison\n  \n on 12 Feb. 2016 // This was a fabulous purchase for my 4 year old, he absolutely loves it and has played for hours with it. It is a pliable \'dough like\'  sand which can be used with moulds and stamps to create castles or anything else your child can think of.  It comes with a good selection of moulds, a roller and a couple of stamps to help create pretty cool looking castles as per the box!The sand itself is excellent. There were two large packs in the box and it does not dry out as claimed (we left ours in the open air for around 3 days and it was still like new) by the manufacturer.Overall this was an excellent gift for my son! He loves sand and \'play doh\'  and since this is like those two things mixed together, it is ideal!My only concern when buying was the mess it would probably make and while it does come with a reasonably large tray, the sand does get everywhere. It is however pretty easy to clean up, because it doesn\'t dry out, it also doesn\'t embed in your carpets. It takes a little more hoovering (going over the same spot two or three times)  it does clean up well. On tables and chairs it can just be wiped off back into the tray. It leaves and off residue in your hands also but this is removed with washing.I did find that there wasn\'t anything I could really do with the sand once my son had finished playing with it but I found a plastic tupperwear box that it fit into perfectly.I do think however that the product would be even better if the tray doubled as a sealable box, i imagine it wouldn\'t take much to refashion the tray so that it could support a lid.Even with storage issue, it is an excellent product and my son loves it!

I\'m sure my daughters are going to be over the moon with them :) they look better than what I expected, much bigger and come with a really good variety of playmobil. You get 3 figures, a throne, a selection of animals such as a deer, some rabbits, some foxes, a badger, a peacock, a unicorn, a butterfly and loads more. There doesn\'t seem to be too many rubbish little bits, which I was worried about as I\'m sure my daughters won\'t appreciate opening one of the doors to find a flower or a piece of grass! I also like how there are 2 of certain animals but by the looks of it they come together on a certain day (better than recieving two of the same animal but on different days. I thought the background might be the actual box but it\'s not, it comes with a nice big cardboard cut out ready to add the pieces to, to complete the set.

I have a couple of dozen or so, including this Porsche, which my girlfriend gave to me one year as a present. The AutoArt models which I own all have the following in common. They are exacting in the attention to detail, both exterior and interior, and are made from very high quality materials which give a good tactile experience, even the tyres are nice to touch. The alloys look great and the paintwork is vibrant and eye catching.I bought my first AutoArt model about five years ago and it still looks as good as the day I opened the packaging. The Achilles Heel with these quality models, is the windscreen wipers, which can snag on a cloth if you\'re dusting and get damaged. I stupidly made that mistake once (and just the once!). The best thing to do is to exhibit your cherished model inside a display case or cabinet, free from dust. You can buy a suitable display case for this model, either from Amazon, or else from the MiniModels website.I take great pleasure in looking at my collection of AutoArt models at home, which now includes a couple of Porsche 911\'s, a Bugatti Veyron, Koenigsegg CCX, Pagani Huayra, and a couple of Ferrari 599\'s. Of all of my collection, I think that the orange coloured Koenigsegg CCX is probably the most stunning, you might want to take a look at one on the MiniModels website if it\'s not currently available from Amazon.It\'s always worth price-checking between the Amazon and MiniModels websites, if you\'re looking to buy a high quality diecast vehicle.Thank you for taking the time to read this review. | A Stunning Model of the Porsche 911',5,264,'2015-04-26'),(829,'c203aff5cfcbd5e61878048bbe322ce7',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(830,'c0bfa4cb69a20c85965e0eff789f259b',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(831,'8f4a9ace7bb4ae6e6d8dda96d94bd332',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(832,'55ff5def0c3c8aae245051f6e2154839',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(833,'89d44a1bb9c3fc34b264ff51352a1791',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(834,'1f8bbd31df2ceab3b67c9ac66e4729d3',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(835,'6cf6aeb19bcc8a89d33fcc3e7cb7569c',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(836,'af9511db607fe37119d4487c12f4d91d',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(837,'d27f5bc691982a54530fd90a783af499',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(838,'553f49d8c3633f747f7664b2d895fdff',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(839,'168f748bc19af21dfabafdefb65522a0',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(840,'231cc7273399cc91df8f5d452eea4283',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(841,'078e6408e24484359dffe794f62ab851','Five Stars',5,3096,'2015-05-18'),(842,'62515054f27d711c016cb3d4fba6e531',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(843,'9419106659af5577605f6088991a29f4','Five Stars',5,1567,'2015-05-25'),(844,'bc8a1cf8e70fca486495aae588f1f0ef',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(845,'0cafe5cdc7590a066e52f548b178a5d9',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(846,'b9ce6dff068ed2b4fce6859b83c22dd6',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(847,'75f5256eeca4cd02681d7c837f36ec33',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(848,'53a9ebed98aa235880477ee90eb93d08',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(849,'7fca35221faf1caac4cfa85fa7e05259','A Nice Little Model',5,574,'2014-04-07'),(850,'1d1c8f9716c0299777a9be7f6d7d8705','Collectors model',5,552,'2014-04-02'),(851,'42665040b101d28226cce5edddc82c14',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(852,'5a484b6429eafb966cbba2b1f2acdbce','fantastic // 5.0 // 14 Jun. 2014 // By\n    \n    mark\n  \n on 14 Jun. 2014 // I bought this product by accident,  beware of the \"buy with one click\" facility ,as I brushed this by accident next thing I know I\'m getting an email saying your product has been dispatched, anyway I\'ve always wanted this model to finalise my collection but trying to justify the cost, but once I had opened the box I had to keep it and maybe ironically by doing it this way was the only chance of getting this model then worry about affording later. | Five Stars',5,1366,'2015-05-24'),(853,'a76886a6e1256efb97339148bd2008e0',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(854,'f435261c40adea338dad9e85965541ca',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(855,'cae86bd7e1e128bc677fa52820ebc2b9',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(856,'f0249b32f1b51ca5915eda39d7d78794',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(857,'0db3839c81510139a26f181252e320a9',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(858,'fa1052460de6142d22d40effb50ae3ac',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(859,'94edb0011dae6eb9a378bc28af92448b',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(860,'488f2e1f51d487af9922edeb4d4e159d','Chunky motor',5,2607,'2014-05-23'),(861,'a3f28e208fc1c738172ba51d923a676a',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(862,'8316faacfa0dbf095a5473b9d5149a82',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(863,'e4a77c61539336198b747f06aa44f16f',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(864,'fe3a9e7583304a41e519c7e94dc9288e',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(865,'37849e1aae6b57a2bb17a617d5a7b8b3','Four Stars',4,2429,'2015-07-23'),(866,'e18331295d9827c11faff51439e470d1','did not meet expectation // 2.0 // 3 Sept. 2013 // 3 of 3 people found the following review helpful // I was expecting the traditional red London bus but instead my bus was white.

This version is produced in silver rather than the gold finish of the original model but nonetheless it still features revolving number plates, an ejector seat, bullet proof shield and machine guns etc. evoking memories of the original Corgi model I remember. The quality of the model itself is good, although, the balance that has been struck is making it true to the original model from the 60s rather than updating it, therefore, in some ways it falls short of the level of detail in some of today\'s models.A couple thousand of the gold versions have also been produced by Corgi but are in short supply and command a significant premium - this version is certainly the next best thing. If it\'s any consolation the actual car in the Goldfinger movie was silver, but at the time Corgi are said to have thought that if they produced it in silver it might look unfinished, hence the original model being gold.  I can assure you this 2015 silver version of the model certainly looks finished.

I have the transformers figurines and since childhood I have been collecting all the Gi-Joes and He-Man collectibles (yes including the Castle Grayskull). My reason for buying the Classic Predator model was simple. It is in recent times the most bad-a** character you will ever come across and one of my all time favourites. Once I decided I wanted one of these figurines the next option was to decide the type of figurine I shall opt for. There are many options in the market such as the Berserker, Falconer, Stealth Predator etc., but I wanted a Predator without the mask. For me, the real essence of a Predator is when he/she is without a mask. There were 2 options (during the time of writing this review). I opted for this particular model as it seemed a little more heftier in size than the other one.I must say I was not at all disappointed with the decision. The hard hitting effect of a mask-less Predator is perfectly captured in this figurine. Hats off to NECA for a commendable job. The articulations are many and the detailing is incredible (as can be seen in the customer images I have uploaded). The figure does not have any \"boot issues\" due to which standing without support isn\'t a problem. The articulations allow a good range of poses. The gun is an detachable object which can be removed if you do not fancy it. The figurine is sturdy although the level of sturdiness varies from person to person. I am not sure if it can withstand an excited toddler practising his/her throwing or hammering skills. A word of caution: Based on my personal experience young children can get pertified with the Mask-less predator. Hence if you are going to buy a gift for a child with minimal threshold for fear, look elsewhere or opt for a masked Predator.For collectors like me, this would be a perfect addition to your collection. A must buy.PS: For a detailed review of the figurine check out the OAFE reviews. | Hardly gets better than this',5,1429,'2013-07-29'),(1026,'705c8011113d828c5549f4ef42dffb5a',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(1027,'d1e2cc4e9d2249c12e8ef85993f5566b','Tiny Transformer Toy!',4,282,'2012-04-30'),(1028,'6708aea1dd213de20f1f26821267cb5f',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(1029,'ef10daff938e7fd80f012074be4e29b6','The only good human...is a dead human!!! // 5.0 // 22 Jan. 2015 // By\n    \n    GStar1\n  \n on 22 Jan. 2015 // This bad boy is my first purchase from Series 2 of the classic Planet of the Apes figures from NECA.

Due to the irregular shape, if you lose somthing you will not recover it & it will rattle around inside forever. You might think you could remove a section of hull to access inside, but unfortunately this is not possible, you would have to almost dismantle the entire toy. The main fault is the legs fall off far to easily. They are held in place by a single small pin & wobble, so a slight sideways preasure makes them fall off. Not a problem for a display piece, but when the kids play with it on the floor any knocks to the hull make it collapse. Simplest solution is to remove the legs & bottom turret so it can rest on the hull when being played with , but this prevents use of the ramp & anti-personell laser. | It\'ll make the kessle run in less than 12 Parsects....but it won\'t get past the wife! // 5.0 // 6 Aug. 2008 // By\n    \n    julianM.\n  \n on 6 Aug. 2008 // Ok, if you are a Star Wars fan this thing is a MUST BUY!It is perfect for custom painting is you are into that kind of thing, I\'ve posted an image of mine set in a playset that I made for the kids.It\'s got lights, sounds, moving bits and it is incredibly detailed.The price is as awesome as the toy however, so if you are mad enough to spend the vast sums needed to acquire this beast then you won\'t be dissappointed.There really is nothing more to say! | \"She may not look like much but she\'s got it where it counts kid!\" // 5.0 // 4 Aug. 2008 // By\n    \n    TK-1308\n  \nVINE VOICE on 4 Aug. 2008 // Hasbro release their first vehicle from the new Legacy Collection with an updated version of one of the most loved ships in the Star Wars saga - the Millennium Falcon. The original mould for the Falcon which has been used since the first one was made back in 1977 finally broke after producing Falcons for the original collections and then for the Power Of The Force and OTC range.With a new mould required, modellers took it upon themselves to improve on the original and have given us one of the most impressive Star Wars vehicles ever created with a larger scale, more detailing, a vastly improved interior and loads of light and sound effects.The Falcon comes partially assembled in the box (yes, it\'s bigger than that huge box!) But be warned, once assembled the pieces will NOT come undone - this is a one time assembly people!The electronics require 3 AA batteries. The compartment is under the top of the aft hull which clips off and there is a screw plate underneath.As an added bonus you get two figures Han Solo (2007\'s 30th Anniversary Collection #11) and Chewbacca (2004\'s Vintage Original Trilogy Collection #9) who come armed with a DL-44 and bowcaster respectively.Now, onto the Falcon itself. A massive 10 inches high (when on landing feet), 24 inches across and 32 inches long, the ship is an impressive display piece.For the lower hull there are 7 landing feet which plug into holes in the hull, the lower quad cannon and in the front hull there is the machine gun cannon (used against Snowtroopers in Echo Base) which can deploy out from the hull and has a firing missile in it.Read more › | Millenium Falcon // 5.0 // 7 Jan. 2011 // By\n    \n    cully\n  \n on 7 Jan. 2011 // Although I made a mistake in what I was purchasing, we are very happy with the product.

The last Tarkin figure was in the \'The Saga Collection\' Death Star Briefing Imperial Officers set that was simply a repaint of the ROTS collection Governor Tarkin figure. This Vintage figure is probably the definitive figure of the character (more or less.) First the good things, the figure\'s range of articulation is great, set with the standard of most TVC figures. The Detail of face sculpt is pretty good as well, and is overall the best figure of the character so far, and the Mouse Droid is a pretty nice accessory. Now, the bad things: First off, why do Hasbro keep giving Imperial Pilots and now this Tarkin figure the generic Mercenary sawed-off Blaster that we\'ve only seen thugs like Doctor Evazan use in SW? I for one as a SW fan have never seen Imperial Forces use this weapon, and know for a fact that Tarkin certainly never used one. My other gripe would be the unnecessary fabric soft goods skirt or whatever you want to call it. It just looks goofy, incongruous and generally out of place with the figure. I know I\'ve heard collectors say they like soft goods\' on figures, and in some cases I think soft goods\' on figures work, but as a collector I personally can\'t stand soft goods on figures. Its a step backwards in my opinion.Otherwise, a pretty good figure. 8/10 | At last the Tarkin we have been waiting for // 5.0 // 31 Jan. 2014 // By\n    \n    Chris\n  \n on 31 Jan. 2014 // Grand Moff Tarkin was a noticeable omission from the original Kenner line of Star Wars figures back in 1977 and fans had to wait 20 years before finally getting a version in the new Power of the Force line.This Vintage Collection release of Tarkin is a much improved sculpt and comes with a mouse droid.

I agree with another reviewer in that this is a fair price for it. I don\'t think it\'s worth paying more than about £50 for it and can\'t believe it\'s actually on sale at £128.00 as I\'m writing this.We have quite a few bits from Imaginext and although this is a great toy we\'ve encountered a problem with the lift winding mechanism almost as soon as my son started playing with it which has meant the lift doesn\'t work properly. I would have brushed this off as a one off however we have the fire station set as well and the fire engine hose obviously works on the same system and that stopped working quite quickly too. I think we can fix the lift issue with a bit of DIY repair work but it\'s still annoying to have to do it. But it is still a fun toy*****Update*****After contacting Mattel about the lift problem and getting an unsatisfactory reply and no idea how to fix it I researched it online and found lots of people have had the same problem.. For anyone else who has this problem it can be fixed relatively easily once you know how! Unscrew the screws that hold the red bit into the reel and the ones that attach it to the main structure but not the screws that keep the black reel together. Wind the string around the black reel twice so it\'s very taut and then get it back in place and screwed in without the string coming out again. And hey presto, a working lift!!

Well even though its listed as a toy, it is not. This is a collectable item, and should not be purchased for children. I say this because of the quality of the item. From the tiny extras to the packaging, it is clear alot of effort has gone into creating this item.I will start with the packaging. This is not your standard card. This is sturdy and is a beutiful dark blue. With the new look logo in a orangey gold colour. Also it has a door so if you just want it in the packaging you can still see it. But for those (like myself) who want to have it on display then theres no tape on the box so no rips or tears will be made.Next the extras. Now this is the standard edition so there is a blank segement in the back piece but its only the where the signiture plague would be. You get a base and stand that is theme like the tardis interior glass floor. With the stand being like a piece of the wall. With this are some of the gadgets that the doctor has used mainly in series 6, including sonics and even the tardis fragment from series 5. Each one is painted and detailed perfectly. They look stunning. Also you get extra hands so all the extras can be held. Which is a nice touch.The figure it self is stunning. The clothes are so detailed its unreal. Even to every last button. Plus they include his socks!The main freature would have to be the head sculpt which looks just like matt smith himself. The expression, the hair, the list goes on. Its truely amazing.Ok thats me done. So i will just sum up in a few points.- this is NOT a toy. So dont buy for children.Read more › | A great product from a British company. // 5.0 // 29 Aug. 2012 // By\n    \n    Sharon Woodward\n  \n on 29 Aug. 2012 // This figure has been a long time coming.  Announced last year and arriving this month, there was high expectation indeed for it to be good.And good it certainly is!  You get a pretty good idea about the quality of the contents of the box, just by seeing the box itself.  A dark blue/black background with well done bronze metallic lettering on it.  The box is five sided so has an opening panel, just like the American and Chinese offerings, which shows you your first glimpse of the 11th Doctor in all his glory.Once you get inside the package, the inner is split into two trays.  The first carries the doctor and his immediate accessories and the second carries his display base and stand.  The display base is designed to look like the TARDIS floor we see in Matt Smith\'s version of the Doctor\'s ship.  To those not very \'up\' on the show, it may look a bit...vague and ordinary.  To fans, there would have been no other base appropriate enough!As to the main tray of contents...this contains the 11th Doctor himself and his assortment of accessories, and you do get a fair few, a blue envelope/invitation, a red hanky, a piece of destroyed TARDIS, a Time Lord consciousness cube, various hands in different poses which allow differently expressive poses and the figure proper.The figure of Matt Smith is a joy to behold.  He comes in his signature brown hunting jacket with leather elbow patches, white shirt with bow-tie, red braces, black trousers, white socks (only partial socks though) and black boots.  They are all well made indeed.  There have been a few questions about the cut of the jacket and how the bow tie and collar sit, but these are the types of things that show just how well a figure is made...Read more › | Not worth the price // 3.0 // 5 Aug. 2013 // By\n    \n    Sarah\n  \n on 5 Aug. 2013 // Its very detailed, with interchangeable hands and a bunch of cute accessories which the doctor can hold.  It has moveable arms, legs and head too which is very cool.  The best thing about it is that it really does look a lot like Matt Smith.  That\'s a major plus point because as we all know, you can normally only tell who a model or a figure of a person is, because of the name on the packaging!!

Keep any leftovers for the next project too. There is always a little sequin decoration left on the carpet but it is not generally a messy project and keeps my 10 year old occupied for a long time.They may seem a little pricey for what you get but it is a quality product and a project that keeps your child occupied for a long time as well as having pride in the final creation.These are now standard pressies on all xmas and birthday lists.Highly recommmended - although my daughter is 10 years old, I would think that with some help any age from 8 onwards would find this a lovely present. | Beautiful // 5.0 // 2 Dec. 2013 // By\n    \n    Talitha\n  \n on 2 Dec. 2013 // I love doing sequin art.

Therefore, we\'ve had to buy several new packs of night-glow beads, of which this is one.Out of the different glowing colours the red beads tend to glow the most brightly, closely followed by the green.

I have only just started to paint the picture, but I am enjoying the experience and look forward to having the finished painting in due course. The paints are perfect for use, as in the past I have bought paint by numbers, not from this seller I hasten to add, and sometimes the paints have dried up.  You also get three different sized brushes, which is a novel experience for me.

At nearly £18 I expected better quality and quantity regarding paint and brush sizes.  On the larger fill colours it is insufficient to completely obscure the canvas white.  The colours are several shades different in some cases, most notably the orange and range of greens.  The brown needs to be put on thicker than the quantity allows.

Of great comfort to those who can swim a little and/or stay afloat without aids it would not be recommended for a non-swimmer without bodily attached flotation aids to use unsupervised. As previously said here, it accommodates reasonable sized adult and child, and seems to be of strong construction, it withstood one weeks extreme usage from my 7 grandchildren and their competitive parents.The pool tyre certainly promotes fun in the pool from using it as a \'boat\' for timed \'speed\' trials of the length of the pool, \'King of the Castle\' type territorial skirmishes, diving from the side of the pool through it, or sticking your backside through the centre, feet and head resting on the outer rim and just floating at will, relaxing and pontificating on life\'s inequalities!

It is a major attraction during the warm weather and popular from babies up to teenagers and a few adults have been tempted in as well. The soft, inflatable edge makes it incredibly safe and this summer my son and two of his friends spent a day running across the garden and launching themselves over the side and into the water! They couldn\'t have done this with a rigid sided pool. Once the kids are in bed, parents can get a look in, wallowing in a couple of large swim-rings with a G&T in their hand!You need a surface that\'s as level as you can manage because too much slope causes the water to push against the lower side and the weight could cause the pool to collapse. We have a very slight incline but the pool can cope with this. We rake the ground smooth before spreading out the pool and use a thick ground sheet underneath. We walk over this in bare feet to feel for any missed stones etc. My neighbour has a similar pool and has created a permanent surface, dug into the ground, levelled out, covered in a thick layer of fine sand and with a groundsheet over the whole area and pegged down neatly round the edges. It looks great but we seem to manage fine with our seasonal arrangement. The pool is made of strong materials and in fact we\'ve never had a puncture or hole. You spread out the pool in situ and we invested in an electric pump to inflate the top ring which is invaluable and gets used for lots of other things too! Once the water just covers the bottom of the pool, we pull out the bottom from the edges to remove any creases. Inevitably we are left with one or two small ones...almost impossible not to, but this is the stage to get it as smooth as you can.Read more › | we\'re going to need a bigger boat...',5,3234,'2007-07-25'),(1637,'ffee9727cfb5f53e12dd9d9fca0cf8aa',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(1638,'4b95da9add0d3dd30923323ff1147199',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(1639,'b9682ccb691a5ac3400b64350c174de7','Really meant for toddlers 1-3 years // 5.0 // 3 Aug. 2014 // By\n    \n    Johnboy27\n  \n on 3 Aug. 2014 // Great pool and everything worked as expected.this pool is described as age 3+ I don\'t agree with this I would suggest this is a pool for age 1 to 3 years as this is not built for heavy or robust use. there are several sections that need to be pumped up especially around the slide which is fixed to the pool, the only section that is detachable is the blue ball pit.

Inflates in about 1 minute per section with a decent electric pump and has plugs to stop the air escaping straight after you unplug the pump.It has a drainage hole in the bottom of the pool so that when you come to empty it you can just pull the plug out and let it drain rather than having to scoop the water out or tip it up - which would be impossible considering its weight when filled with water.We have a water meter and estimate that it costs us around £1 to fill it pool as we never fully fill it anyway.  The size that they state for the dimensions are the outside of the pool.  MY boyfriend is over 6ft tall though, and he can lie down in it fully with his arms out so it has a substantial inner size.As suggestions - we also bought the INTEX cover from a different amazon seller.  It fits easily over the pool.  I was a little worried that it would have no overhang as they state that the cover is the same size as the pool but this is not the case.  This will save us having to empty and re-fill it every time we want to use it.Also, we\'d recommend that you put something under the pool (an old piece of carpet, a large flat cardboard box etc,) as the \"floor\" of the pool is just a thin film so you do feel any bumps underneath it.Overall, really happy with this purchase and the seller was very helpful. | Ok but not the best.',3,2902,'2013-07-18'),(1729,'fbd8329ae94af261e231b2fa814f5869',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(1730,'0a4da93a63f3ecacf47c830f25cb2788','good',5,715,'2014-05-18'),(1731,'fa15fdd6fa875fa9ceaab2c10cadaf39',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(1732,'8bc71d1590324d835f2447473eacc3c8',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(1733,'f1b301331cec85f92fea09709dde4bda',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(1734,'eee6f264563e61d690ceabb6a8bb28d6','Thoroughly enjoyed and great fun // 5.0 // 12 Aug. 2013 // By\n    \n    Peter Burr\n  \n on 12 Aug. 2013 // Thoroughly enjoyed by my 2yr+ old  - great fun.

If you\'ve got the space, it\'s a really excellent toy.Assembly is a little difficult, and really I don\'t think a child could put it together very readily. It took three adults half an hour to assemble it out of the box and there was a lot of humming and hawing and \"Am I doing this right?\" moments. The joints don\'t really click together, and you often have to brute force things. Despite this, nothing broke, and the joints were all watertight (although my nephew quickly managed to splash water everywhere. No real surprises there). Once assembled it was sturdy and we were able to move it with no bother.The other wee problem was the boats that come with it, which I think are just kind of naff. Some of them aren\'t watertight, so wind up filling up with water, making them totally useless. In general they\'re just a bit too big and fat. The canals themselves are massive, and you could scoot decent sized boat toys around them no problem, but the ones that come with it are just a little unwieldy. Not holding this against it, though, because it\'s easy to get- or make- other boats to put into it. What you\'re buying here is the canals, and they\'re beyond reproach.I looked through a few Big Waterplay sets before finding this one, and it seems to be the only one with a lock/pump/slide mechanism. This is the best part- allowing your child to raise boats up with the pump, then send them down the slide on a torrent of water. It\'s great fun and a very cool mechanical lesson too. I was a little dubious as to whether it would all work at first, but it works a charm. The pump, the watertight gates and the lock all work.Read more › | Great value lots of fun // 5.0 // 19 Aug. 2013 // By\n    \n    Katharine\n  \n on 19 Aug. 2013 // Great value, good quality. 3 different layouts are possible.

K. Tilbury\n  \n on 9 Mar. 2012 // Needing to be dressed up for a Disney themed fancy dress party, this Mr Incredible costume seemed exactly what I wanted.  As the title says, Size Matters!  I\'m 5\'11\" tall, weighing in at 13.5 stone with a 36\" waist and a 42\" chest. Not wanting to look like the suit was too big for me and to then lose the \"muscle\" effect, I chose the LARGE size, which was stated to be for up to a 42\" chest.  I can confirm that the jumpsuit fitted fine, nice and comfortable throughout, with a decent sleeve length (think M&S regular shirt sleeve). The legs were fine too, and the length is not quite as important as the bottoms have generous PVC sleeves that sit over your own boots, so providing your boots are say, Chelsea Boot style or longer, then you\'re sorted.The eye mask is fine, nicely trimmed and stretchy enough to fit even the biggest bonce. The gloves are OK, a bit loose, but they add to the super hero look just fine. This suit doesn\'t have the flashing chest logo, but then I didn\'t think that was essential for the look.  Overall the suit/chest/muscles are good and you\'ll look the part.The only slight drawback I have found is that the orange PVC belt which \"trims\" your waist to give you that \"pulled in\" look (oh I wish!) is a little bit lacking in length.  Whilst I could just about get it to catch on the velcro fastener, it was only just long enough to fit my waist (just under 36\" remember?). This will probably need to have a panel made to fit in-between to finish off the costume properly, otherwise from the back you see a big bit of white velcro hook/loop tape and it will inevitably be catching on other threads if people brush against it.Final downside ...Read more › | Fancy Dress // 5.0 // 6 Feb. 2014 // By\n    \n    JW\n  \n on 6 Feb. 2014 // Grest mr Incredible fancy dress costume, loved the fact the chest pad lit up at the press of a button.

Kelly\n  \n on 30 Nov. 2009 // Bit of advice to any potential buyers: look carefully at the connections shown in the picture...as the manufacturers want this to be compatable with both classic and sport track, you can see the fasteners are not the same on both sides.The way this connects to your track is by a \"converter\" piece which transforms what seems at first glance to be a half-length accessory to the size of a full length track piece.  For some sets with few or no customisable straights (a figure of eight track, for example) it can be challenging to find space for it without a big rethink.Due to restricted space I ended up having to cut/file away fastenings from a couple of mis-matching pieces and super-glue them together.So, don\'t make the same mistake as me.  When planning your track, allow a full track length for this accessory! | Lap Counter - A useful addition // 4.0 // 5 Jan. 2005 // By\n    \n    A Customer\n  \n on 5 Jan. 2005 // The lap counter is great for keeping tag of what is happening on the race track.The cars move so fast and if they do happen to leave the track, it is often difficult to work out who has done how many laps - not now.Not only does this accessory count down the laps (which can be set independently for each lane, therby introducing a handicap system) it also times each lap showing the fastest time for each player at the end of the race. This gives another \"opponent\" to beat.The set also includes a convertor straight to make it compatible with both the classic and sport track sets.Overall a great addition to any scalextric set. | Scalextric Lap Counter C8215 // 5.0 // 27 Dec. 2009 // By\n    \n    Mr. R.

Rather than send back and disappoint my daughter, I spent 15 minutes cutting out the offending plastic so the cars could pass un-obstructed.

My son is pretty quick to pick things up and had the little cars going down the track in no time at all (I admit I rather hoped he\'d spend a little more time occupied in trying to work it out but never mind!). I would advise caution when giving this to younger children because the cars are rather small and the track is very light and easy to lift, so supervision would be required for smaller toddlers to avoid swallowing and head-bashing.

The metal end caps on the axles have come off meaning that the the small wheels have come off and also the axle that goes through the car has come out.

Our son already has another of this type of racetrack and it is worth noting that the cars are not compatible; although they look the same, the wheels are different sizes so each car can only be used on the track it came with.

Look after this \'mat\' do not try to hoover it, eat off it, sleep under it or use it for a \'camp\', bathmat and if unsupervised children want to fight with it or use it to slide down the stairs on, they will probably destroy it. We roll ours up around a cardboard tube when put away, not folded up, the tube keeps it looking like new. With this mat, which has a non-slip rubber backing, there are endless scenarios for the coloured printed images on the topside as you would find in any town or city. Our grandson insists we get the \'mat\' out each time he visits us and as yet, after nearly six months has not tired of playing with it. Get some cars, a little train and maybe a matchbox helicopter. Also the sets of wooden cars/buses/fire engines etc. which we also purchased (London Set) under the \'Le Toy\' name, add to the fun. The wooden vehicles are well made and run freely.

If they sell well, proving to MS that they have customer interest beyond the usual sets, then there is a good chance there will be more in the future. So, if you are on the fence a little bear that in mind. For a tenner. cliché or not, you really cannot go wrong here.Over at the group I race with - google \'eahorc.com\' to check us out - we have been working with MS steadily over the years, trying to get them to take the 1/64th line more seriously. The smaller scale has major advantages over the more traditional 1/32nd fare, costing much less and needing much less space to set up as a permanent track (on a board behind a sofa for example).What holds it back it that people - from parents and grandparents looking for presents that are not video games to racers such as myself - are not as aware of 1/64th as they are of the bigger, much more expensive stuff. Carded cars for a tenner are a good move. Coupled with the cars being bright and fast, they are a real winner.Bear in mind slot cars and slot car track need maintenance. At eahorc we stand ready to advise parents and other buyers how to get the most from what they buy in the 1/6th scale.

At first glance they look quite similar there are actually few components that I can see that are the same from the original except for the ones that shouldn\'t be the same, like the camera itself.First the good:Much improved performance between generations - it climbs and flies much faster than the original Bebop (OBB) making it useful for more applications where it previously would have been too slow.Battery life is up there with the best consumer drones at 20-25 mins which should be enough time and range for typical scenarios.It\'s around 25% bigger than OBB but you get a lot of extra performance for a small impact on portability whilst it\'s still small compared to the DJI Phantoms, meaning you can put it in backpack whereas other drones need a \'look at me everyone\' attache case.The new BB2 colour scheme design looks seriously impressive and reminds me of the DJI Inspire 1. The OBB looks like a kid\'s toy.Overall build quality is much higher. The H or X is more aerodynamic and much stronger so I think crash costs will be cheaper with this version.New battery loading mechanism is light years ahead of the embarrassment of the OBB.GPS performance, which was awful with the OBB is absolutely rock solid now and gets quicker and better aquisition so you\'re less likely to have drone incidents.The camera can now face straight down instead of mostly down and slightly ahead with OBB.Switches on and off faster than the original.The rear flashing light is extremely useful as it is so easy to lose the drone or orientation even at fairly close distances.Read more › | Incredibly fun and easy to fly // 4.0 // 10 Jan. 2016 // By\n    \n    playmade\n  \n on 10 Jan. 2016 // I was a bit nervous about my first couple of flights due to a couple of reviews about this drone disconnecting, however I am now on 10+ flights and haven\'t had a single problem.Good points --Faster and more agile than expected.-Really easy for a novice to fly and incredibly stable.-Responsive with little lag on the controls-Quiet compared with other quadcopeters and helicopters I have flown. You can\'t even hear it once it\'s quite high.-You can place limits on the distance and speed of the drone. I found this useful for my first couple of flights, so I wasn\'t concerned about it flying away.-Return home function for when the drone is out of range-Flight time of 25 minutes and a chick charge time of only 45 minutes.The bad -I can\'t really think of anything that bad to say about this drone, other than navigating through menus in the app can be a bit clunky. That said, the actual flight controls in the app (free flight mode) are top notch. You can download the app now and have a look, but the free flight mode will only appear once your drone is connected.Flight plan (this is like an autopilot mode where you can set the path of the drone and other parameters such as altitude, speed, direction, and where to take pictures) is an additional £14.99, which I was initially annoyed at paying, but it turned out to be worth the money. It\'s also not  essential or even something that all users might use, so I can see why they chose to sell it as an add-on.Additional points --Only 1 battery included. Additional batteries are £59.99. I was going to order another battery, however the 20-25 minutes of flight time seem to be enough at the moment (especially in the cold weather).Read more › | Disconnects from Flightplan too easily.

My review is honest, unbiased and not influenced in any way.Superb fun these mini drone type things are! They have a learning curve, well for me! It comes well packaged with great design and all the key specs splattered around the box. Within the box, it comes complete with everything that you need to get started. The mini drone itself, the remote, and a pack of spare blades and the battery USB charger. The battery for the mini drone is built into the mini drone itself and charges via a small port underneath the On/Off button.The remote requires 2 AAA batteries. Operation/setting up is simple, pop the 2 AAA batteries into the remote then flick On for both remote and the mini drone.This was my first ever mini drone, so I spent a few minutes to just read the manual. The left stick is for the throttle of the rotors, and the right stick is for directions. It\'s quite difficult, especially as I was trying to play with it in a confined space, so I guess that didn\'t help. The great thing about this little one is that it helps you identify which way is forward. The two light coloured blades are the front of the drone, though my driving skills were still in mayhem!I found that even if I didn\'t turn left or right, the drone would still float in a certain direction, after reading the manual again, I learnt about the Trimming buttons that counter act the natural floating of the drone, definitely makes it easier to control after learning that.The only downside with these drones is the flight time, you only really get to play around for 5 minutes or so, then need to charge them for 45 minutes! Overall, it\'s great fun, definitely something to get the kids, but make sure you have plenty and I mean plenty of space as one of those flying towards you isn\'t fun!

I noticed immediately the difference in size between these and the stock plastic ones, as these are much longer and wider, so I stuck them on my Phantom and - owing to the enormous amount of lift - it took off like a stabbed rat and I tested their strength by immediately crashing it into the roof of my house. Not a single scratch, bend, chip was observed. As I thought it would take some getting used to flying the drone with these racing blades attached, I reset and once again launched it at full-titty straight into the eaves of the roof, and, because I am more stupid than the average man, tried to catch it whilst the rotors were still trying to un-invert themselves and very nearly had the top of my index finger sliced clean off by the still-turning blades. Having administered the appropriate first-aid and cleaned up the surprisingly large amount of blood from my hasty retreat inside, I put the Phantom with its OFTEN 9443 Self-Locking Carbon Fiber Propellers CW/CCW away and left it there for fear of it trying to kill me or any number of my housemates. | they look VERY sturdy and are not as flexible as the originals // 5.0 // 15 Aug. 2015 // By\n    \n    David Price\n  \n on 15 Aug. 2015 // Not yet used and arrived one day earlier than was advised. they look VERY sturdy and are not as flexible as the originals, they seem very strong indeed.

I have been a DJI Phantom Quadcopter owner for a while now, so am always looking to acquire products associated with it; when I saw these I thought I must get a set and review them.The standard type of blade guard attaches itself directly to each of the arms (obviously, 4 in the case of a quadcopter), and are designed to provide added protection to the blades, should you have an accident, such as a crash landing or powering the Phantom in to a tree, for example. These Blade Guards from HobbyTiger are somewhat different to the standard – and I have never used this type before – in that they have two parts to them; one part screws on to each of the arms, and the blade guard itself then simply pushes in to this, with a reassuring snap. To take them off again is a simple matter of squeezing the end clips and pulling.The blades come with a small Allan key, and all the necessary screws for attaching to the Phantom. There is also a length of thing cord; this connects to each of the blade guards and again adds a bit of protection for the blades; however, I never use this, so I left this off. I was a little concerned that the extra weight that these two-part blade guards would provide may have a slight effect on my Phantom (they can be really finicky with weight increases of any sort), but I am pleased to report that they had a negligible effect, so that was good.The blade guards themselves are made from plastic, but seem robust enough, and unless you really hammer your quadcopter in to the ground hard they should be ok.Read more › | He was delighted to receive these as he\'s already had a little ...',4,914,'2016-04-02'),(2318,'c0651a1fe06087b3a96c927cbe12e0e5',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2319,'56e3f40b3dbf7f8781e32da53a0e3aea',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2320,'cd3de22a7352fa98f45f60dadd58ca77','Cleared for take-off! // 5.0 // 19 Feb. 2015 // By\n    \n    DocandNurse\n  \n on 19 Feb. 2015 // Very quick delivery.

The helmet printing gives each character a different look, almost a different attitude.The general has a large hammer type weapon, whereas the warriors have either a big plasma-gun type weapon or a well-used sword and shield.  The general is the only one to have the clear blue armour..The banner is a nice addition to the sets – it is a more solid plastic material with the image of a roaring ice bear on both sides.The builds are small two rock formations and a disk firing machine.The disk firer is shaped like an ice bear’s head which is a nice touch.  The firing ability of this machine is less impressive.

However when it was reduced just before Christmas I decided to make it my daughters main present and members of the family offered to buy some of the furniture too.It arrived promptly and was really well packaged. The large box contained lots of small boxes and bags but the instructions were easy to follow and everything was well labelled. It took me over 4 hours to put this together and the finished castle looked stunning. Unlike other children\'s toys the many stickers actually stayed on but I ended up having to glue parts of the castle together because it fell apart every-time I moved it. Once glued it has stayed together despite being played with frequently. I was surprised at how big it was but there was plenty of room for play and has some lovely little features, my favourite being the little secret compartment to keep your jewellery in and the matching tiara to wear while your playing. Unfortunately the little plastic flowers on the bushes have not stood the test of time and have slowly fallen off and ended up in the Hoover. It doesn\'t take away from the fact that it really is a lovely piece of furniture for any princess bedroom, I just wish that some of the furniture had come as part of the package too. | Fantastic! // 5.0 // 25 Dec. 2012 // By\n    \n    Max Power\n  \n on 25 Dec. 2012 // A brilliant but very intricate castle.

The car has a pull back and let go little \'motor\' allowing it to speed ahead, which is great in itselfThe figures are neat. Buzz can be attached to his rocket and has little wings too.Colour wise both the packaging and models look lovely, very striking.The model is very easy to build.

Available from both the Disney Store and The Lego shop, so dont be fooled into paying collectors prices. Me and the 25 year old loved putting the model together, took about 20 minutes and is quite straightforward. The 4 year old has had great fun playing with the models, making up his own games and stories with them. He is also learning that lego comes apart and can be put together again - sometimes with different heads! So I think it is good for young children using role play and developing their fine motor skills. I have found the attachments for Buzz\'s helmet visor inadequate too - it comes off too easily. The spoiler on the back of RC is a little top heavy and needs regular refixing and the lights come off easily - but then hey it is lego & if bits come off your child is going to learn how to put them back again.

Said he wanted a lego kit and we got this one because he likes toy story, even though it is slightly older age group.  He needed help from Daddy to build the car.  The car is excellent, really speedy - pull back and it shoots off, so we had a few races with that and another vehicle.  Bits drop off the lego car all the time as it bashes into things, so be careful not to lose them.  Eventually we left it as a kind of \'skeleton\' car without too many bits left on, which was kind of fun.  But oh the joy of this toy was the little mini buzz lightyear and woody that come with it and are supposed to sit in the car.  They are also lego (ish).  Woody has had a bit of a look in but the little mini buzz is totally adored.  You have to put him together with all the lego bits - after that, there are options - you can pull his head off (great fun!)  Remove his wings and/or his power pack - put the head back on, leave the wings off and so on.  Our little one wasn\'t interested in the car much after the first week, but mini lego buzz has been everywhere and goes to bed with him.  He talks to him, flies him around, makes him talk back, and so on.  Mini lego buzz has become a personal friend, and worth the whole kit just for itself.  I think it has worked better than getting the action talking expensive buzz (which we considered) - it\'s the smallness and the fact that you can pull bits off and put them back again, that makes mini buzz so special!

Not to much of a problem though and it does come with 6 men rather than just 1 as is usual with this type of thing. | excellent birthday present // 5.0 // 6 Sept. 2013 // By\n    \n    cheryl\n  \n on 6 Sept. 2013 // My son was very happy when he opened this on his birthday.It arrived in plenty of time and the product itself was good quality and the instructions were easy to follow. | Meccano Gears of war',5,1621,'2014-07-10'),(2436,'f38038174a8c8fb7f25c7dd09f9a2fca',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2437,'5117fb8b972e89434512d321a5932f9e','A wonderful toy! // 5.0 // 25 Jan. 2013 // By\n    \n    Middlemarch\n  \n on 25 Jan. 2013 // I cannot recommend this toy highly enough for little girls aged two to three.

The tree once built stands a good 8inches tall so its quite an impressive kit once complete, theres also a seperate rock/warg launcher piece with the set which is suprisingly very solidly built and is used for hurling fire bombs into the tree or hopping wargs into it.

There are no Goblins in this set as they do not appear at this point in the movie and the sets are based on the movie-verse not the books.  I guess where left behind in the mountain with their King.It is a good 400 piece (3 numbered bags, one book) build which produces one magnificent large tree and a large \"stone\" plinth.  The tree can be turned/rotated 360 degrees at 2 places in the trunk.There are also 2 little \"burning\" areas where the dwarves have thrown the burning pinecones at their approaching enemy.The build includes 5 mini-figures and 2 wargs:- Thorin Oakenshield - 2 faced - nice printing on torso (front and back) - nice hair piece - comes with sword and battle axe.- Bifor - 2 faced - nice printing on torso (front and back) - excellent hair piece but it covers the face and a lot of printing on the torso - comes with brown cape and spear.- Yazneg or Azog the Destroyer (depending on which box you get) - single face - excellent face printing - has scarred back of head printing - cream coloured collar piece which covers the nice torso printing.  This Azog appears to have black shirt sleeves but should be shirtless.- Orc 1 - single face - nice hair piece with attached ears - detailed printing on front torso and back - comes with a battered and bitten sword.- Orc 2 - identical to Orc 1 but comes with bow and arrow quiver instead of sword.- White Warg - the ride of Yazneg/Azog is a beautiful piece and has a moveable head and jaw - has blue eyes.Read more › | great set',5,58,'2013-07-27'),(2477,'03eae72cca501696d2ac0fa6458ebfbc',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2478,'d1d07caa09cb5437881ad0bd7d3901a3',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2479,'c8a388d7dda1b49635c389987a2a1ba2',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2480,'ed74cf295675f6759587177f046d4a83',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2481,'c5c13ebeb2799255f36c3d0a2f9a3ce0',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2482,'41cd8bf3cfed53b93890ee6572d6cfb3','He loved it.',5,1872,'2014-05-01'),(2483,'0f6b62fd7c3e3f8a50f3d95d0f3923e5','Police Pursuit',5,1141,'2016-04-04'),(2484,'b2dc1e16ea646e69bc85dbbbf33ce3a4',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2485,'069fbe2f7785bba4b3e0a5358f00065e',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2486,'31db1e35e4a1e3ccfc47dc7ab8382d6d',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2487,'e9b9759dbca526827bea823f8f6ef114',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2488,'62e8cc7fd2a7289874f62391584fc6a1',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2489,'c9f06f8bcaf32a9d76bb572ab3db6794','Five Stars // 5.0 // 15 Feb. 2015 // By\n    \n    David Booth\n  \n on 15 Feb. 2015 // good value, increased my collection of matchstick models | Five Stars // 5.0 // 12 Jan. 2015 // By\n    \n    derek sproston\n  \n on 12 Jan. 2015 // nice kit with clear and plain instructionsDS | Five Stars // 5.0 // 23 Nov. 2015 // By\n    \n    Amazon Customer\n  \n on 23 Nov. 2015 // This is a present hope it looks good built | Five Stars // 5.0 // 30 Dec. 2015 // By\n    \n    alexmc\n  \n on 30 Dec. 2015 // Impressive model | Five Stars',5,2246,'2016-04-08'),(2490,'66c2e63e5eecf66604f5eb56535bf3f1','Fantastic Minifigures, Awesome Play Value, Rubbish Build. // 3.0 // 1 Mar. 2016 // By\n    \n    Mr. Ba Corbett-mills\n  \n on 1 Mar. 2016 // As a LEGO and DC fan I often pick up the full range of sets (If I can afford them) and it\'s great to see a cheap support set for the Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice movie. However, this set doesn\'t really stand true to the quality I\'ve come to expect even from these smaller sets where there are obviously limitations on the designer.I feel a good effort has been made to create a scene from the movie and some great play features have been incorporated, but that for all intents and purposes this is a very loosely put together mash of bricks. It feels like something a child would make themselves when trying to recreate said scene - which of course is cool for kids and does encourage expansion of the scene in play.On the other hand, you do get two excellent minifigures, armored Batman is fantastic and although it\'s a shape the \'armor\' section covers some really intricate detailing on the figures torso he looks awesome overall. As a plus the glowing elements used on the head are great and really represent the armored suit so well. Superman is fairly standard but it\'s great to see both main characters from the movie in such an easy to purchase set.Overall this is worth picking up for the minifigures alone, but don\'t expect an exciting build or an awesome display item as it doesn\'t hold up so much on that end. Buying for kids though, then this will be a winner as the play value is huge! | A batsuit that can put Batman toe to toe with Superman. // 5.0 // 9 Feb. 2016 // By\n    \n    Losinglemo\n  \n on 9 Feb. 2016 // A neat little set highlighting the battle between Batman and Superman, containing a cool armoured Batman figure, which is currently exclusive to this set and an even cooler Batsignal to either display or interact with in the fight, hours of imaginative play can be head as the two one time enemies and original super pals, slug it out in the name of Justice.

So now, at 38 years of age, I finally feel ready for it :-)I bought this model and, upon opening the box, found two instruction booklets - one to make a buggy, the other a tractor - and three bags of Lego.  The box could have been a lot smaller to be honest, but never mind.  I decided to make the buggy first.  No tools are required, and unlike \"normal\" Lego the pieces are all very different - there are small studs of a sort to link pieces together, some gears, plastic rods, wheels and so on.  The instructions are reasonably easy to follow, every step being illustrated, the parts colour coded, and where two pieces could be mistaken the book provides a 1:1 scale drawing of the piece so you can hold the parts against the diagram to check.  True, there are a few fiddly bits, and it is baffling at first as you assemble a few parts and wonder when it will finally look like the picture on the box, but it gradually takes shape.After two hours or so I had finished building the buggy, and I was delighted with it.  The completed model is pleasingly large (30cm long or so) and has lots of moving parts, such as suspension at the front and rear, working steering (there is a cog on the roof of the car which operates the wheels, but you can also move the steering wheel if you have tiny fingers), a hinged roof section, tilting seats, and an engine (note that the model isn\'t powered) where the four pistons move up and down as you push the car along.How about the tractor?Read more › | Lego Technic Buggy // 5.0 // 6 Jan. 2011 // By\n    \n    Sandra\n  \n on 6 Jan. 2011 // We bought this for our 6 year old son for Christmas & although his dad had to build most of it, he took great pleasure in finding the pieces to help his dad put if together.

Just like the Lego VW Bus, this model has lots of amazing detail and working features. With 1077 pieces, it feels like a real accomplishment when the entire thing is finished.The pieces are in numbered bags, so you can get started building without sorting much. This model is rated for 16+, but certainly a younger Lego fan with experience could get this assembled. At certain points, the car is still quite unstable, so caution needs to be taken or you might break pieces off while building. Once the car is assembled, it\'s quite sturdy. The color scheme---British Racing Green with tan/white interior---is a great look and perfect for this vehicle.Doors open, seats tilt forward, trunk and hood open, and top is removable. Stowed in the trunk is a picnic basket and blanket, with the spare tire hidden beneath. Lots of nice details can be seen: inside the engine compartment, on the dash, the upholstery. Racing stripes and Mini Cooper logos complete the look. Lego has provided a variety of license plates so you can customize it for the country you prefer.Always shop around for the best price and consult the Lego site for suggested retail.

He has a few Star wars sets but not that much.The Jedi Interceptor is a fairly straight forward build, quite suited to 5-8/9 year olds or older. What I like about this set is you get R2-D2 (always worth having him) and Anakin Skywalker so two play figures in addition to the Interceptor (he\'s collecting figures too)Play wise it\'s quite good for kids; when it\'s built up quite a strong construction which will won\'t fall apart with the younger ones playing with it. You also get two missiles which fire, a cockpit that opens and folding wing flaps. The missiles are spring loaded and have a fair bit of kick behind them (more than you think) so ideal as a play toy for the kids they can set up figures and have a little battle firing the missiles.Price is very fair, and it\'s good to see some newer Lego designs coming out.

It also comes with a handy bag that closes to keep all the bricks in, as well as a little tool to help get some of the smaller bricks apart.All in all, this was a great present and I will definitely be buying more sets. | great toy // 5.0 // 4 Mar. 2016 // By\n    \n    quietlady\n  \n on 4 Mar. 2016 // I bought  this for my 5yr grandson who lives away as a little gift as I don\'t get to see him or spoil him like the other grandchildrmy son said he loves it and has cheered him up no end as he\'d ben saying how much he wished he lived in uk with nanna so thank you so much for making a little boy happy  the toy arrived very quickly and well wrapped thank you | ... when I saw it on the website but was disappointed when I received it',3,823,'2016-04-04'),(2557,'acae9c927a9a6f3adc91a68befa93420',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2558,'7063c30e2c6467139d00aad9e12363fa',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2559,'efd9c9f866f61fea0ad8a382441f0012','Lego at it\'s best',5,781,'2015-07-20'),(2560,'3a44802027829f18e6d52ae29be5840b',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2561,'18893949132f1b51ae690940bba53c36',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2562,'d53732164d9bac68ed6dcc19eb764235','Minor negatives, Great representation of the film // 5.0 // 7 Dec. 2015 // By\n    \n    dmcnabb\n  \nTOP 500 REVIEWER on 7 Dec. 2015 // I purchased the Avengers Quinjet City Chase for my son who loves to display Marvel Lego sets in his bedroom. The price on this set has always put me off, but I grabbed it when I saw it on sale for 49.97. For that price, I felt it was really good value. You get the Iron Man, Captain America, Black Widow, Vision & Ultron figures. In this series of Lego, Ultron changes as he does in the film. In the Tower playset he is a bit shabbier looking and lacks the helmet. In this set he is in his final complete form. Also its exciting to see Vision in the set. He didn\'t appear long in the film, but great to see they have included him. Visions cape is a different feel from the usual lego cape and is much softer and the material is slightly elasticated. This set is reminiscent of the film and the lego is a good representation of the vehicles used. you do get a variety of lego tools that go into the back of the jet. Also captain americas bike drops into a hatch at the top of the jet and with the press of a button falls out of the bottom of the jet. There is also another A Avengers button that launches missiles on one wing and another matching button on the other side that drops a minifigure from the bottom of the wing to allow them to swing into action. There is also the truck which carries the minifigure pod. With a press of a button on the back of the truck, the truck whips open and the pod comes out. Alot of the pieces used are bespoke to this set and have been really well thought out. A good example is the window at the front, which I have never seen that length or in that colour.There are a couple features that I felt were over looked. Mainly being the motorbike, which if stood exactly upright sits up just fine, but tips very easily.Read more › | Great quality.',5,957,'2015-05-07'),(2563,'8275ce6a9eb0cb4f39fb8abc005379ad',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2564,'714717535ada4489d3142c3c0580b57c',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2565,'3d689a5aae6b33d38b2b9f722e9d35a0',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2566,'435becb9b5db7c5c058dd5802d5fa466','One happy grandson',5,1629,'2013-07-22'),(2567,'4bf2bc55e5e65db68dfc808ed386e784','NIce, medium size model.',4,1326,'2006-07-17'),(2568,'31e9f26be41cb8960aa5e8e157819c86',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2569,'4af06ddad546eb788906cbb54d16c08c','My son loved this - it is a great vehicle',4,2873,'2015-05-18'),(2570,'a1210448395e60572d10add1eb03952c',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2571,'9e283e4aeddfe35be116a76a64a292fc',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2572,'a33c936ac3f5cbf0eba940ecfca8e180',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2573,'7a2f20fb33b92a83eec6d2587cf0f62d','Building on Maths // 5.0 // 13 Aug. 2011 // By\n    \n    Home School\n  \n on 13 Aug. 2011 // Our son is struggling at school and so we have decided as a family to continue educating him throughout the summer holidays.  This was a real dilemma as we wanted to make it fun but not too much fun that he strayed off the subject - MATHS!  While we could have used \'Lego\' this would have been too tempting for our easily distracted 6 year old: so we thought about what we could use. When at school ourselves my husband and I remembered 1 cm cubes that could be collated, stacked and built with and so we looked for the same and came across the \'Learning Resources Snap Cubes\'.  We thought about value and bought the large pack of 500 and when they arrived we were not disappointed, even though they were not exactly the same as the ones we used to use ourselves (reminiscence) they are the next best thing, as they are so much more versatile than the boring old ones we had.We set to using them and found they could be turned into cubes, stacked and best of all easily used by our son to count with because of the bright colours.  He has already learned his two times table (and enjoyed it), we are now tackling the 3\'s.  We have a box of resources for learning but these are the resource tool of choice for all the children that visit, they love them and don\'t realise they are learning (of course with guidance). | Visual Aid for children with Numeracy problems // 5.0 // 20 Oct. 2011 // By\n    \n    Cheryl M-M\n  \nTOP 1000 REVIEWER on 20 Oct. 2011 // My son is having a some difficulty with Numeracy/Maths in Primary School. I was looking for a way to help teach him at home. These cubes are an excellent idea, because he tends to learn well with visual hands on aids. It is one thing to add numbers in black and white on a page and another to see those numbers add up or be reduced in a real life setting. The only negative thing I can mention is the fact the cubes are sometimes awkward to get on and off. My son unfortunately would rather play games with them.

Unfortunately, these aren\'t the exact same product used in schools, as the quality isn\'t as good, but for home use they are pretty good value and really help your child to visualise how much 10, 20 or 100 etc. is. Also helps with 10s and units.They can sometimes be a bit hard to disconnect from each other, and some are too loose when they connect together. Also, the ones I remember had a distinctly satisfying \"click\" - these don\'t have that.The only thing I would suggest is, for one child, you probably wouldn\'t need 500 - as that\'s way too much. 100 is perfectly enough if you can buy it separately. If not, maybe split it with a friend. | Excellent resource',5,1172,'2014-05-30'),(2574,'c7cc40b54c17d01ab820f5e9e91cc6dd',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2575,'d2860d64f8eaf4cdbcd7adf120635f3d','Anoth great piece from the Technic team. // 5.0 // 16 Jan. 2014 // By\n    \n    Robert K\n  \n on 16 Jan. 2014 // This is yet another great piece from the Technic team at Lego.This Container truck (or skip lorry as we would more commonly know it in the UK) is affordable, fun to build and can be extended with the optional motor set.The product falls inline with previous sets from Technic in that it is construction themed.Having made many of the previous sets it was extremely easy to follow the instructions and build this model, and it is very straight forward to add the optional motor (I also added some lights to make it a bit more flash!) | lego truck',5,1857,'2014-05-30'),(2576,'49cddfd9666f21fc5c9fa35bb1458880','My review',5,2700,'2011-05-15'),(2577,'353191e015d7a6dfe162cff63df4bfeb','Excellent',5,2159,'2013-05-29'),(2578,'2a2ee24a91fd41206a825b872fe7ee65',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2579,'2ab614d27dc9f98220151b85268cb39e',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2580,'22066402b3bd5ffd9d006807db70662f','Brilliant.',5,615,'2012-05-07'),(2581,'380bdbd6c9c21d7455bddf088c101bb3',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2582,'a1d75406e5b3cf200e6bb66da845fc63',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2583,'cbfb07a0ca6b14964331027c42d6b1c2',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2584,'69e33bb775e4381742a14f38bfbf5eff',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2585,'370d64397bc5cb5758741b46070562ce',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2586,'1e92038340f2d5430f21a8a602f8a001',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2587,'2db06ab5d45ce6d9bf4620b4572beeec','Good gift',4,2121,'2012-05-15'),(2588,'d3b21db4fd100d8735e93dc6bf907551',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2589,'4067a2b6cc9a0d8cdb3a967b1855dd79',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(2590,'04a0cd291ac5803f34ef4f307e731423','Real Meccano // 4.0 // 29 Oct. 2011 // By\n    \n    GrahamG\n  \n on 29 Oct. 2011 // There seem to be two kinds of Meccano on the go now - one type is largely plastic and uses a lot of preformed parts which mean, in effect, that the job is virtually done for you.And then there\'s this kind. Real Meccano, where you have to use your imagination, ingenuity, fingers and tools.We\'ve been gradually buying most of the traditional Meccano sets for a young relative of ours who displays an unusually advanced aptitude for taking things apart. Supplying him with Meccano has ensured that he is now more usually preoccupied with taking his own stuff apart and putting it back together. Which is good.As much as I approve of Meccano I would specifically recommend this set as an add-on to an already purchased set which came with a motor, a gearbox and a set of conventional wheels, the reason being that this set then gives you something new and different that you don\'t get in most of the other sets - a pair of caterpillar tracks, the special grooved wheels to run them on, and a cable mechanism which is good for making a lever mounted in one place on a model remotely control something somewhere else - in this case the boom of the digger illustrated, but you can use it however you like, of course.As far as I am aware, none of the other entry level or mid-level sets contain these parts.Please note that the no.15 kit does NOT come with a motor. Some of the other kits do, but this one does not.Recommended as a supplement / add on to an existing set, rather than a first purchase. | Lots of handy parts // 4.0 // 30 Jan. 2011 // By\n    \n    Mr. Sean R.

We couldn\'t afford it though, and I was likely too ham-fisted a child to have made much progress.Fast forward to an adult me, who just watched a whole tv programme about Meccano and suddenly realised I can afford it now, plus have the time and the hand-eye co-ordination required. I couldn\'t resist!I\'m happy to report that its every bit as much fun as I hoped, maybe more so - this set includes a 3v motor so you can make your models zoom around, and the satisfaction from assembling the motor and watching your axle spin round at the flick of a switch would surely be wasted on a child. These are modern revamps of Meccano, so some of the pieces are plastic, most are solid metal with the familiar holes in however, and the fiddly screwdriver assembly method has been replaced with a more user-friendly Allen key system, which tightens up nuts and bolts beautifully (and untightens equally well when you\'ve made a mistake..)Gone too are the frustrations of all these clever bits and a lack of clue how to turn them into something - the kit comes with full colour, clear, step-by-step instructions for 8 models, and by putting several together you really do start to get some ideas for what other things you could create on your own. I\'m sure the average 9 year old would get on great with this toy, so if you have children and were pondering, take the plunge. Just buy a set for yourself to fiddle with once they\'re in bed though, or just keep the treat to yourself! And if you are an adult, keep it out of the range of your parents, my mum is itching to have a play too. | Still going strong // 4.0 // 4 Jun. 2014 // By\n    \n    Taponne\n  \n on 4 Jun. 2014 // This was a birthday present for a ten-year-old great-nephew, whom I have only met about twice. Not easy to choose well, but apparently our presents are always \"fabulous\" so I have a reputation to keep up! I reckoned meccano should be about right by now.So, I wrapped it up with a message and sent it off to China, where it arrived in fourteen days -- not bad. It was apparently pounced on by the birthday boy and his father, who set about making the most complicated-looking model together. I had compared various kits and read the reviews, and this one seemed more versatile than some. It\'s good to have the parts and instructions for a specific construction, but you also want to be able to make your own creations.I had been tempted by a motor, but the reviews suggested they were not really strong enough, which might be disappointing.

It can hold up to 12 deck boxes which is great for storage especially on the go if you travel with plenty of decks to tournaments or game nights etc however the user would be better served if you could adjust the size of the compartments by removing one of the cardboard dividers so you can fit in larger boxes such as the deck builder boxes which most people tend to keep instead of buying multiple deck boxes. Also i would really like it if the box were a little larger so it could have a compartment specifically for your play mat tube so everything can be kept together and perhaps having at least one compartment with a detachable lid so you can have the option of using it to store deck boxes, or attach the lid to store you dice and counters etc Another little idea would be to build two life counters into the inside of the lid so the bag can become part of the game with a pretty handy feature :)So just some suggestions i would like to see implemented in any future updates but overall a good product but for reference the box you will receive is the one in the second and third picture, good to be able to keep my decks in one bag together that i can just pick up and go so i would recommend this to anyone who travels with their cards or to those who just want something to keep all their decks together and safe | Excellent // 5.0 // 23 Dec. 2013 // By\n    \n    Nuno Fernandes\n  \n on 23 Dec. 2013 // Perfect to keep my cards well organized.All space is well organized and this will keep my cards with original state.Delivered on estimate date. very good service. | <3 Its perfect for my MTG collection // 5.0 // 13 Oct. 2015 // By\n    \n    Vearos\n  \n on 13 Oct. 2015 // <3 Its perfect for my MTG collection.

However, what I was left with intrigued me, I was left with an efficient dragon spamming deck, which I improved by adding in more Lightsworns and a Tyrant Dragon. The deck, with the majority of the hands I have drawn, allows for the rapid summoning of heavy hitting dragons. My best advice would be to abuse Lightpulsar Dragon to get Red-Eyes Darkness out, and then use Darkness to get Lightpulsar back. By abuse I mean Tribute. (Which is a reason on its wn to keep Monster Gate in the deck.) | One of the best structure decks yet. // 5.0 // 16 Feb. 2012 // By\n    \n    4.1.13Buckley\n  \n on 16 Feb. 2012 // This deck has some of the best reprints i have seen in a deck for a while. You get a Chaos Sorcerer a Red-eyes Darkness Metal Dragon and a Dark Armed Dragon as well as Blue-eyes, Red-eyes, Book of Moon and Call of the Haunted.The new cards are also very good, Lightpulsar and Darkflare are a easily summonable 6 and 5 star monsters with respectable attacks of 2500 and 2400, Eclipse Wyvern is a very handy card allowing you to get out 7 star and higher monsters out with ease. Chaos Zone is a little hard to use and should not be treated as the focus fo this deck, Dragon\'s rebirth however is excellent.Where the deck mostly falls down is with it\'s low level mosnters. White Stone of Legend, Red eyes Black Chick, Lord of D and Kaibaman are all decent blue/red eyes support cards but some of the cards feel out of place completeley, Snipe Hunter and Summoner Monk are both very good cards but there is no real reason for either of them to be there, except maybe for the latter supporting the four-star lightsworns in the deck but seeing as one of the two\'s effect is about attacking there is very little point. However there\'s a card more out of place in this deck than those two, Mystic tomato. There are 4 cards in this deck that meet it\'s summoning requirements; one is itself, two are the aformentioned Snipe Hunter and Summoner Monk and the last one is red-eyes black chick. This really doesn\'t justify it\'s place in the deck at all.Overall a very good deck but if you intend to play with it, buy two. | Stating the obvious? // 5.0 // 19 Jun. 2012 // By\n    \n    Elliott Stanbury\n  \n on 19 Jun. 2012 // This product is one of the better Yu-Gi-Oh purchases my brother and I have made over the years.

They are well made, have a nice design and good quality artwork.Applying the stickers to the correct locations was reasonably straightforward and the bubbles generated underneath the stickers were easy to get rid of.The product looked very good on our white toilet seat but not as effective on the black toilet seat. The feedback that we had from the party guests was of a positive nature (along with  a couple of screams!) and they hadn\'t seen anything as unique as it before. They didn\'t expect to see any props in the bathroom.The stickers were not as easy to remove and I ended up ripping the seat sticker to an unusable state. It is possible to use them again but you have to do it very slowly and carefully.I believe that the product offers good value for money given the price tag and I would therefore recommend it.Feedback:If you wish to provide feedback on this review then please follow the link below.Thanks | Gruesomely awesome // 5.0 // 22 Dec. 2012 // By\n    \n    J.

Some kind of polyester, reminiscent of bad pretend silk, BUT the cut and overall effect of the costume really works.  The detail of the attached waist coat, chains and sleeves, topped off with a very generous cape is as good as it will get with regards to a manufactured mass produced costume.  And after all it\'s Halloween, it\'s the effect we were after, this costume is certainly one of the better ones without spending a fortune.  I ordered a size Medium for my husband (40-42), he is a 38 chest, and this fitted just right, in his words \"wouldn\'t want it any smaller\".  The arms are a bit short, but not noticeably.The reason I give this product 5 stars are for the fact that I ordered at 7:30AM on Tuesday, it was despatched the same day, and delivered (FREE of charge) Thursday morning 9:30AM.  The price from this seller was competitive and I only found one other on-line retailer selling for less, but adding the standard (3-4 day delivery) it was the same price.  Thinking about hiring or searching stores for the same product would have cost a lot more in time and money.  And to be honest while the material is chinzy, I think in comparison to other costumes out there it is rather good quality.Note however it is not washable or dry cleanable.  Sponge clean only.  Also does NOT come with trousers or cane.  But my husband is happy to wear his own black trousers, rather than an ill-fitting pair.I would highly recommend this costume if you are going to that fancy dress party and want to take the hassle out of choosing between the selection of dracula outfits online, because you won\'t go wrong with this.  As I say, I really don\'t think cost wise and the effect this costume gives can be matched.  So all in all a good buy. | Sizing is small, anyone above 5ft 8\" needs XL // 3.0 // 14 Oct. 2015 // By\n    \n    Paulus Magnolius Esperantus\n  \n on 14 Oct. 2015 // So my costume arrived on time as usual. I can never complain about delivery from Amazon.Quality wise, it is fine. Perhaps not really worth the £30 or so it costs but it is OK. I noticed a few loose strands of cotton around the buttons that had to be trimmed off. But it does look better than most of the cheaper outfits you will find in certain supermarkets.Sizing is small. I ordered large, I\'m 6ft and slim build so fit between medium and large depending on brands with normal clothes. This thing feels short, sleeves are short, it doesn\'t reach my waist so I will have to wear a black t - shirt underneath.I would suggest anyone who is taller than 5ft 8 needs to buy XL. | High quality for low price // 4.0 // 22 Oct. 2014 // By\n    \n    lance kerrigan\n  \n on 22 Oct. 2014 // What came was great... The cloak was very good quality and exceeded my expectation considering the price... I also liked the top... The costume generally is very good quality not tackie or cheap looking. The one down side (hence the lack of fifth star) was it doesn\'t come with trousers which is an addition piece to costume to get later... I recommend a cheap pair of suit trousers to go with this costume...

One day she said \"Well, where is my cosutme then.\"  As a person who has had to shop in Evans for larger size clothes in the past (although she is losing weight and look good on it) I didn\'t think even if I could find a costume it would be any good.  Seeing this outfit advertised I thought I would buy it if only to give her a laugh.  When it arrived I was disappointed at its condition.  Although it was new, it had obviously been taken out of its original packing and stuffed back in.  The costume was creased and not well presented.  I would not have accepted it in this condition had I seen it in a shop but it was not so bad that I felt it should be returned.  When I gave it to her I got the laugh I wanted.  When she tried it on, however I got the thrill this costume should evoke.  It was far better made than some of the dressing up outfits and even the boots fitted.  My only complaint is that the zip at the back doesn\'t stay up (Maybe it was designed to fall open!)  It is a costume that could be worn out to a party and not just to stay on for a few minuets in the bedroom.  It even made her feel better. | A little on the large side // 3.0 // 15 Sept. 2015 // By\n    \n    Peter B (1)\n  \n on 2 Sept. 2011 // The overall look of this outfit is brilliant!

I ended up taking it in about 4 inches as there was an excess of material on the back and it did not look pretty! Also the overboots that came with it were huge! So big they would have gone round my legs twice! Thirdly, Wonder woman didn\'t have a cape so this was surplus to requirement.

So a classic enduring kit and at a very moderate price. Like the other Matchbox Revell kits it is cheap and easy to build with a decent level of detail, certainly for the price. Also the Matchbox Revell feature (not found in recent Revell modeks) of a bit of battle diorama and a couple of figures. Late model of Panzer II, which served largely in a reconnaissance function by this time after earlier service as light battlefield tank. Not one of the best Panzer designs, but had a significant role in the earlier part of the war. This a great classic kit, suitable for beginners and those who want a modelling collection that includes some of the older designs. Not many Panzer II models available at present, though options for early WWII armour are improving. So an essential buy for WWII German tank modellers in this scale, particularly good of beginners and those who want to cover earlier war models in their collection.

I do like a challenge but was getting heartily sick of things not fitting and excessive flash to clean up on the cheaper kits and ludicrous complexity and needlessly high parts-count with the more expensive ones.The Leopard went together faultlessly in a weekend. Tamiya mouldings are always crisp and clean (no flash) and this is no exception. The instructions are crystal clear, the construction sequence is logical and feasible.....you\'d be suprised....and even the rubber-band tracks look the part. Poor tracks let down so many tank models - no need to resort to after market track-link sets here for any one except hardcore rivet-counters.The kit IS thirty four years old now (1979 moulded on the lower hull) and thus not \'state of the art\' but it was a breeze to build and looks a hell of lot like the real ones I saw zooming around the arena at Bovington Tank Museum last summer.

The density and thickness of the mask came as an acquainted surprise as the material appears ever more solid and structurally sound than I had originally assumed. The mask has thick, durable straps and clips attached to the sides via metal pins and can be readjusted to fit. The package addressed to my location WAS addressed to me, yet another\'s name suited the box. However, that\'s a forgivable technicality in my eyes due to the underlaying quality of the product. The measurements are smaller than I had insinuated yet remain a decent (adult) size. However, I can merely drop the measurable notion to fiction as I had not read the measurements given by the seller.My only one complaint is within the protective foam layer that was/is presumed to be attached to the mask before application. This layer was not attached to the mask upon purchase or unboxing despite coming with the mask, but this can simply be applied to the mask by the customer at any point.Overall the mask is a keeper, an eye catcher and 100% movie accurate for those looking for more precision. The quality and structure are sound and the paintwork only captures that quality ever so more. For that, this masks receives a 5/5. | This is a really good product.

Vastly overpriced and obviously reliant on a current craze, I honestly thought it was akin to something you would think twice about buying from a pound shop.The item came well packed but, the box it was in appeared to have kicked around the warehouse floor before actually finding its way in to the packaging.The \"glitter\" doesn\'t shimmer, sparkle or do anything in particular to justify its inclusion. I expected something like the old \"snowstorm\" paperweights that you used to shake, but the foil cut outs only decide to move very slowly upwards once it is held upside down and then fall equally slowly back to the feet again when turned upright. Shaking it does absolutely nothing to increase the movement and whoever designed it obviously did not have the time or inclination to carry out any serious research.I have given it two stars because my granddaughter appeared to like it although I did not see her actually play with it for long. For me it\'s less than one star, but then again I am someone who (probably unrealistically) expects a bit of thought and effort to go into things - even if they are \"only\" for children - rather than profiteering from the \"tat\" that this seems to be. | Misleading // 2.0 // 25 Oct. 2015 // By\n    \n    marie\n  \n on 25 Oct. 2015 // So disappointed.

On the ogre\'s back is a handle with a trigger which if squeezed will make the ogre raise both his arms and roar/moan. This ogre can interact with the Fisher Price Imaginext Castle, if you pull the trigger anywhere near the castle a knight\'s voice will shout \"ogre, is that all you\'ve got\" and \"he\'s in a bad mood\".

My son got this for his 6th birthday and it is his favourite present- he is dragon and dinosaur mad.It comes with a knight and weapon accessories and there is a small bit of assembly needed to put the wings on but this is easy to do. There are plenty of pricey extras that complement this such as the dragon castle but this toy is great on its own and doesn\'t necessarily need the castle and other bits if your child is not a Playmobil fan. | Run! Run! The dragon\'s coming!! // 4.0 // 18 Jan. 2011 // By\n    \n    A. Milne\n  \nTOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 18 Jan. 2011 // My little boy was lucky enough to get this large Playmobil dragon for Xmas and loves it!Whilst this dragon is certainly not cheap, as with most Playmobil it is very durable and feels sturdy and well made. It is pretty large - approximately 38cm long, 20cm tall depending upon how you have posed his wings, and has a wingspan of approximately 45cm. He also comes with a rider who is kitted out with armour, an axe and an extra long lance. The dragon itself has moveable wings, arms, legs and the mouth can be opened and closed. Oh yes, it\'s probably also important to mention that this terrifying creature can also breath fire! In the upper part of his mouth there is a little LED light, (batteries are supplied with the dragon - hurray!). When you press the button on his nose his nostrils slowly flash red four times and then his mouth is lit up with a flickering red light. Personally I think it\'s quite a nice little touch...but of course it really made the toy for my son!Overall I would recommend this to anyone with a dragon-loving child. I marked it down one star just because I think it\'s slightly pricey, but I don\'t actually think it\'s bad value for money. It\'s had a lot of play from us and is still looking like new - I imagine it will last as long as we\'re wanting to play with it. | more dragons // 4.0 // 26 Dec. 2012 // By\n    \n    jeanette leuers\n  \n on 26 Dec. 2012 // Im very bad at \'presents\' so was extra pleased when my grandson gave me a list of playmobil \'catalogue numbers\' to choose from, that took all the grizzly doubt out of \'what to buy\'.  I was a bit shocked - opening the ginormous box of the \'dragons dungeon\' (before buying the large seperate \'dragon\')- to find so much *empty space* in the carton,  that I subsequently used to fill with my own extras - but on close inspection, I decided that the \'playmobil\' name for durability, and value - was not entirely unearned. All the plastic bits, if not meeting any High Art standards of design - looked very solid and unbreakable. My grandson is a whizz at these kit builds, (they look impossible to me) - (he is 6) and he assembles them all so fast I feel inadequate - not bringing the entire catalogue listfull -  at once. At any rate - shopping for playmobil dragons became my best fun thing ever.The brilliant flashing blue light of the Dragons dungeon - scared me out of my wits, when my GS waited in the garden, as evening fell, outside the house with it - and I could see nothing else, so it looked as if the cops were on an urgent call.I was determined not to miss out on the big dragon, but had to send it after I had left - so didnt get to see it \'made\'. I got the message from his pa later - that (as others have reported) its wings were jolly difficult to fix BUT pa and son had sorted that out together, so happy kit-build-bonding for them both - was very good news for me. If anyone knows where I can get the HUGE castle now, for approx half its 80-130 ££ price tag - do tell??? | Brilliant buy // 5.0 // 25 Mar. 2012 // By\n    \n    S Roberts\n  \n on 25 Mar. 2012 // 7 Year old son loved this and he is now 8 and a half.

My boys, 3 and 6, love to play with it. BUT, whoever let this pass through product control should get fired! Yes, really. If you put it together according to instructions, the pieces don\'t fit together and the castle is under so much pressure that it does not take more than a little push to break it apart. So every 5 minutes you hear the cry \"Muuummy, can you fix the castle, pleeease!\"Today I sat down on my own and tried to figure out where the problem is and it very much looks as if one wall is missing. Another reviewer said you could buy the extra wall from playmobil, but hey, is that really the solution? The instructions in our pack date from 2010, so since four years Playmobil is selling this product with the same fault and driving thousands of parents insane ( I wish grandparents would stop rating this product with five stars, they don\'t have to put it back together 20 times a day).This is not the quality I would expect from a German company with a long tradition and it is disgraceful that they do not fix the problem after four years of people pointing out the design fault.For everybody who has bought it already I would like to point out the review from Bobster (December 2012) who is a genius and has found a way to build this castle that makes it not perfect, but much more sturdy.

The instructions could make things a bit more obvious for a couple of the wall connections! Otherwise, it makes it easy to make a faulty connection.  With everything in the correct place, it\'s great!Here\'s the solution to the wall problem / walls not fitting properly:Make sure that the walls that attach to BOTH sides of the big tower (with the trapdoor and steps that can be raised up by pulling the chain) are as far forwards as possible. The instructions make it look like the initial wall that attaches (with the slate roof) goes into the posterior holes (there are 2 lines of 3 holes on each side; I assume to make it cheaper to construct) but, if you do that (like I did) then you get all the problems listed above.It took me ages to work it out (I even tried moving things round as per Bobster\'s suggestion) but it all fits fine if you keep the connections in the front holes (nearest the inside of the castle).

However, the more reputable company \'Corgi\' have also released a Delorean box set a few years ago. Same scale model, except it comes with an extra die-cast figurine of Doc Brown, and scenic packaging.The model itself is a lovely little thing - very well built, and extremely detailed. It\'s metal structure feels solid, and is great to have a little play with; mostly because it\'s so unusual! The tyres are sadly plastic, as is the way these days, so I wouldn\'t advise pushing it around on grainy surfaces.If you have the choice, do enquire about the Corgi model first. Better packaging, the extra figurine of Doc Brown, and possibly more collectable in the future?(I rated the Toys Educational Value as \'3 Stars\', purely because it doesn\'t tell you how to travel back in time!

The crane claw goes up and down, back and forth and the arm rotates. There is also an alternative little platform that can be used instead of the claw. It looks striking and is taller than my son which makes it a really bold, lovely toy! If you have a child who is into knocking things over, it wont be suitable as it will fall over with a good push. This doesn\'t mean it falls over easily as we all know little kids are strong and like things to crash! My sons autistic and hyper all the time and he manages not to push it over so most 3-4 year olds plus will be fine. Theres space for a little figure to sit in the drivers seat (I didn\'t get a figure with it as the picture suggests) and theres also a little counter balance box the other end of the arm and a platform. Its just a lovely lovely toy and my son adores it. If you have like JCB digger toys or a duplo farm set or similar you can do some lovely play.

Unlike the harvesters that are available in the US made by Bruder, this one actually functions.  It comes with little plastic pellets that you load into a hopper and you are able to crank them out into a dump truck...this feature was important to my son as he researched combine harvesters exhaustively on the internet and was very emphatic that he had something that \'worked\'.  This is a great real-life toy.  It is large and provides hours of fun, indoors and out.

The model is very big, highly detailed and very striking when finished.There is no flash at all. The manual is highly complex over 55 steps. The model is very complicated to make due largely to the fact that you have to paint, transfer the transfers and detail before assembly which is unusual for a build.You build the interiors first before you insert into the hull and then i would recommend doing a dry fit before final assembly.If you are into modelling, this is great build with experience. If you are starting out or have not alot of experience, then i recommend you stay away from this model.This model is undervalued in my opinion and should be more expensive.The subject is the William bauer, excuse my spelling, which was built by the Nazis  at the end of world war 2 and was the most advance submarine in the world at the time having a maximum speed of 17 knots under water and could styed submerged for long periods of time unlike it predecessors. It was basically the marine version of the me-162, if it was unleashed in time it could have won the war for the Nazis as it could avoid depth charges easily. The Nazis scuttled it and was raised and restored 12 years later.So an interesting subject matter as well.Very cheap price for a great kit and is an eye stopper. | Christmas Gift // 5.0 // 15 Jan. 2014 // By\n    \n    Dave P\n  \n on 15 Jan. 2014 // Excellent detail and quality.  as a regular model builder I enjoy a challenge.

The \"doodlebug\" isn\'t what I got this model for, but it\'s a nice bonus to have. Both the Meteor and doodlebug have display stands with information and names of the aircraft on them. Both are 1:72 scale as well. Overall, very pleased with this model.

I don’t know what I was expecting when I ordered them, but because of the price I was anticipating them being rather small.  I was mistaken!  When they arrived the packaging was HUGE.  I pity my poor next door neighbour who took it in at my weekend place- she had to store it for a few days.  One thing I really find frustrating with Amazon is that packing is often damaged.  It doesn’t matter when the product is for yourself, but when it is a gift even when there is just a small tear in the outer packaging it looks unprofessional.  Unfortunately this was the case here, and the box was ripped.  The product did arrive much sooner than the stated delivery date which was good.The product itself was a great size- really large, although the book that it was holding is quite small, and not attached particularly well.  It does look of good quality though, and it certainly doesn’t look cheap.  I have already given one of them as a gift for a 2 year old, and they LOVED it.  They started cuddling the rabbit straight away, and then sat there rapt whilst listening to the story.  I haven’t seen the TV show but my friend did say that the voice sounds exactly like it, so that was good.  There seemed to be a variety of different tales available, and they are different each time so they will capture a child’s imagination.  The one problem you might encounter is that if they like one particular story you don’t seem to be able to have the option to repeat it.  I am sure that wouldn’t be an issue though.Although the recommended age for this is older I do think it would be suitable for much younger children.  My nephews are both 1 and one of them in particular loves stories and books so I have no doubt that he will be happy to sit there and take it in. | 5 stars // 5.0 // 8 Oct. 2015 // By\n    \n    yummy mummy\n  \n on 8 Oct. 2015 // Another lovely peter rabbit product, very happy with it, you can remove the journal for cuddles with peter at night as well my son loves it | Love this!',5,298,'2015-07-25'),(4438,'de2fcbed5e502ba88978bbb7d49e2a63',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(4439,'cd443df3850c090cb577bba76dc294d9',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(4440,'0f25ee69c87652f09e4ab5f9b62b19b6',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(4441,'82cf0fce68424ca38ce665c2cb9bed11',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(4442,'4e3c29179f96b3b8490768aaa784052b',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(4443,'c1c16b212fa72e324c53d575339697c8',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(4444,'5624904bcaea9ac34a2907a31d909118',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(4445,'94caa7058ac18c43588a1a46938aef4d','Great! // 5.0 // 7 Jan. 2015 // By\n    \n    Cheryl-Ann\n  \n on 7 Jan. 2015 // This lil guy is awesome!

The main body is a very thick, long-\'fur\' fabric (which can shed a little in its first few uses) and the feet and beak are made from brushed nylon.  What you can\'t see from the photo is that this \'Bird of Paradise\' puppet has a softly padded chest/tummy area so is quite plump.  In use, her head appears to sit back slightly due to the padding giving her greater character and personality.This large-size (approx 40cm long excluding tail) puppet can be used by young children, teenagers or even adults. I have large hands and long arms but still find them comfortable to use. The large beak is very easy to operate and, unlike some other puppets which force the operator to move both the upper and lower beak/jaw, it is easy and comfortable to move only the lower beak. This is a much more natural and realistic movement than raising the upper beak for the bird to \'speak\' or squawk. The squawker inside the mouth is surprisingly loud and makes a fairly realistic bird-squawk sound rather than a typical squeaker-squeak. It can also be removed, if preferred.I use these puppets to make entertainment videos for a mostly adult audience, including a special needs group of adults. I\'ve found that adults with a sense of humour seem to appreciate them just as much as children of all ages from toddlers to pre-teens. They\'re very versatile, great fun and I think they offer exceptional value for money considering their quality. I have nearly the full range of these birds and I generally operate them in pairs with them interacting together for performances.  The puppets have different squawks so can \'communicate\' together in a variety of tones and pitches!A very good buy and great fun too, limited only by your own or your child\'s creativity and imagination. | Brilliant puppet!',4,2875,'2013-05-13'),(4574,'bbb8200c0aa139e2632035bd5a546e82',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(4575,'704b2192734cdbacefc8a0e022244595',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(4576,'0d792b0faa4cd53c71588845d28e7862','Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous // 5.0 // 27 Sept. 2012 // By\n    \n    Isabella\'s Aunty\n  \n on 27 Sept. 2012 // This is such a beautiful toy, the picture doesn\'t do it justice.

My 2 year old niece loved it and immediately set about pulling all the animals out and bringing them to life.  The animals in the tree include an owl, a bird, a squirrel, a fox, a badger and a hedgehog.  The fox is slightly bigger than the other animals and is not a finger puppet.  The hedgehog is smaller and I couldn\'t really get my finger into it properly, however, it is fine for my niece.

Frankly, when I\'m around they\'ll have to be. It\'s mine. But if they really, really want it and cry until you relent, because babies know how to play you and grind you down, you should bear in mind that it comes with plastic eyes.Plastic eyes could be construed as a slightly silly thing to put on what will inevitably become your carefree infant\'s new best friend but they look great, as does everything else about it. The image on this page doesn\'t do the real thing justice, it\'s a beautifully made representation of the Border Collie, of generous size, very comfy and equally durable and it makes the world feel like a better place.These are so fantastic that you\'ll probably want a second one so you can wear them like gloves. Better still, get the yellow Labrador, which also doubles up as a Golden Retriever, to be your Border Collie\'s partner in playtime.(PS. My reasoning for giving this five stars for educational value is still very much a work in progress, but could you really begrudge it a clean sweep?) | Really cute! // 5.0 // 3 Oct. 2008 // By\n    \n    Red Squirrel\n  \n on 3 Oct. 2008 // This is an adorable puppet, with lovely soft fur.

There are LOADS of stickers allowing more oppourtunity for creativity and for each child to create a very individual looking creature - if you gave different children the same paper bag animal to make they would look different. I like the fact that each unassembled puppet is in its own plastic resealable wrapper - easy to put unused kits aside for another day and know that you have all the pieces & stickers together. The chunky glue stick (one enclosed) is very practical - the type that is pinkish in colour so you can see where the glue has already been applied - but it dries clear. Older children should manage to make their puppet with minimum help maybe just watch that the pieces are glued onto the correct fold of the bag. My kids aged 7 and 5 loved these - and of course the bonus is that you can play with them afterwards.

He was curious but in the end he put it in the hallway and closed the door on it proclaiming it was \"a little bit scary\". this means that we (the adults) got more fun out of it that the child but maybe when hes older he will come back to it.

The main body is a very thick, long-\'fur\' fabric (which can shed a little in its first few uses) and the feet and beak are made from brushed nylon.This large-size (approx 40cm long excluding tail and feet) puppet can be used by young children, teenagers or even adults and a \'baby bird\' version is available purely for children.  I have large hands and long arms but still find them comfortable to use.  The large beak is very easy to operate and, unlike some other puppets which force the operator to move both the upper and lower beak/jaw, it is easy and comfortable to move only the lower beak.  This is a much more natural and realistic movement than raising the upper beak for the bird to \'speak\' or squawk.  The squawker inside the mouth is surprisingly loud and makes a fairly realistic bird-squawk sound rather than a typical squeaker-squeak.  The puppets have different squawks so can \'communicate\' together in a variety of tones and pitches but the squarks can also be removed, if preferred.I use these puppets to make entertainment videos for a mostly adult audience, including a special needs group of adults.  I\'ve found that adults with a sense of humour seem to appreciate them just as much as children of all ages from toddlers to pre-teens.  They\'re very versatile, great fun and I think they offer exceptional value for money considering their quality.

The crow is large with lovely soft black plumage and bright yellow beak and feet. He is well-made and full of character. My 10-year-old son loved him on sight and his wonderful caw is being well used. We already had the Green Amazon parrot puppet who is also fantastic. They are an exuberant pair and a lot of fun for kids and adults. What I really like is that they are not the same puppet just in different colours. The crows eyes are to the front of his face, the parrot\'s are to more to the sides; the crow\'s beak is longer and they have easily differentiated sounds too.  A few weeks ago the Green Amazon\'s squeaker started to falter - no wonder considering the constant use over the last year - so I contacted The Puppet Company to see if it would be possible to purchase a replacement squeaker.

This was so important because now she could relate to it on friendly terms. Once we\'d done this she addressed Collin and not me who was operating him and doing his voice.Overall, I think this puppet has enormous potential in getting information through to my niece as she was attentive when \'he\' spoke and she did pay attention to the detail in what he was saying.I was very happy with the purchase and would highly recommend these puppets if you want to encourage your children to be creative and imaginative through play no matter what they\'re capabilities. | Crazy Crow review',5,286,'2011-07-11'),(4712,'916de1d79bd6c6b16e3409132c707598',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(4713,'3caacc2257e4153328346d5d3c79fb61',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(4714,'00650699de429f9eb6a146c0cd488de4',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(4715,'0af4ef3fe4a37ca5dbf129ac2e8ad858',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(4716,'8c7f47f2ca41483cfebec30e6d3744c1',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(4717,'2f57bc05d41fa3520b35e28737fb1132',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(4718,'4b5ec598fb8301d249e0b8c5f583355d','Great!',5,1439,'2015-05-02'),(4719,'7c27db685b7dccb34cfbd9bfade92b1c','A lovely toy // 4.0 // 2 Feb. 2009 // By\n    \n    Kate\n  \n on 2 Feb. 2009 // The telltale theatre and shop is a lovely toy.

I usually leave the assembly of toys to my husband, but I couldn\'t wait to put the theatre together.  Assembly time was 20 minutes and will be much quicker next time now I have the hang of it.  It was very easy to assemble - no screws or complicated instructions.  I like the fact that this toy can be used on a table top without the bottom half, or free standing.  It can be taken apart and stored in the compact and fairly strong cardboard box with carry handle when its not being used. It arrived within 4 days and cost £12 less than the same one in my local toy shop.

Potts\n  \n on 19 Aug. 2012 // This is a well made, good looking toy as you would expect from Melissa & Doug. But, like the endless comments about lots of their great toys being let down by an obvious flaw ( most often the beautifully packaged product has no lid), this toy is let down by a couple of obvious flaws. The chef looks a lot like a Muppet (this is not a problem unless your little one doesn\'t like the Muppets).The most fundamental problem is that the arms have no holes in to work them - you can only work the mouth. This makes any puppet a bit one-dimensional, but particularly a puppet that\'s supposed to mimic an \'active\' role like a chef. I also couldn\'t detach the long wooden pole that came fixed in the puppet\'s hand either, so the arm in question just flopped about hopelessly. A well made toy let down (again...)by a couple of fundamental design flaws. What a shame.I don\'t know if M&D read their reviews, but looking at the vast number of \"beautifully made toys but let down by the lack of a lid\" comments, and thinking the same myself about products I\'ve bought from them in the past (stamping sets, cooking toys)I\'m starting to wonder if they\'re resting on their laurels, and whether Melissa & Doug are benefiting from \"Emperor\'s New Clothes Syndrome\" - everyone says how wonderful their toys are but really, they aren\'t as perfect as we\'d all love them to be. | Great value for your money // 4.0 // 7 Nov. 2012 // By\n    \n    Debbie K.\n  \n on 7 Nov. 2012 // I have a lot of these puppets, including the cook.

The dragon is slightly - but not excessively - fierce-looking, so not too scary for using with children, and is beautifully made from red fabric with gold detailing.My only criticism of this puppet is that, unlike others I have bought from the same manufacturer, only the mouth of the puppet is manipulated by adult hand/arm movement (you put your hand into a slit at the back of the dragon\'s head, rather than inserting it up through the dragon\'s body). You are, thus, left with the dragon\'s weight being supported by just your hand. Since he is a large and well-padded beast he can get quite heavy.Ideal as a prop for re-enacting Julia Donaldson\'sRoom on the Broom | Fantastic',5,1127,'2012-04-06'),(4734,'803c75b7ca050a48d1accf0a11ebd466','Superb Quality and Detail // 5.0 // 21 Mar. 2012 // By\n    \n    Cfp\n  \n on 21 Mar. 2012 // Got this for our 11 year old son who has some learning difficulties.He has always wanted a puppet or two.So we got him this and the crocodile.He loves role play and these puppets are great for imaginative play.They are better than i expected for the price, great detail and durability.These are well loved toys and are taken everywhere ! | Tellatale White Boy // 4.0 // 21 Jan. 2012 // By\n    \n    Lululu\n  \n on 21 Jan. 2012 // I use this puppet to teach English to french children aged 4 to 8 years old.  I love it and they love it too. I use in conjunction with the white girl and they get up to mischievious tricks together.  It would be ideal if the mouth parts were a little easier to use (the natural resting position is \"open\") as it\'s quite difficult to open and close.  The arms and hands are not really operational as you need most of your fingers and thumb to operate the mouth.  This is the biggest drawback because it would have helped me if the puppets could touch things, point etc.  Still ... for the money they are good puppets.  NOT toooooo robust actually.  The little girl\'s dress started to come apart the first time I used it and they\'re not washable. In spite of these drawbacks I still think that compared to other puppets they are quite good value. Maybe next time I will invest in something a bit more expensive, but I wanted to be sure I could use a puppet in an educational setting to good advantage before spending a lot of money. | White boy puppet',5,2161,'2012-04-21'),(4735,'1f5d2a56cdf7acecd27d5f47b42a441a',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(4736,'eb1bd60be6d207c9bfa6da940d7b6708',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(4737,'1dc98caac579077fc9c8600e6e4e2700','Easy and fun to bring to life!',5,1025,'2009-05-30'),(4738,'222bcbec693b6e04f4ccbeec635c4742',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(4739,'f3a026c0f84b10bc38d65d4eccde24e3','many happy moments with this guy! // 5.0 // 14 Feb. 2014 // By\n    \n    Elphie\n  \n on 14 Feb. 2014 // he might be a bit smaller than I would have liked, but bought for my nephew who has a larger puppet, so great for him to use at the same time.

It doesn\'t appear to be the most eye catching toy, particularly as B have used clear plastic casing (which lead my other half to ask whether it was a prototype), but it is undoubtably the most enchanted toy I have come across. The toy springs to life with the most beautiful music which sounds incredibly like the real thing. There really are endless options as you introduce different instruments to pay different songs. My nearly two year old loved it as soon as he saw it and he will play with this for years to come. I haven\'t come across anything else like this before - it is such a beautiful and clever idea. | Absolutely marvellous: engaging, tasteful and FUN! // 5.0 // 10 Nov. 2014 // By\n    \n    Sisemen\n  \n on 10 Nov. 2014 // I bought this on a recommendation from a friend for my 3-year old musically-inclined little boy. Like other reviewers, I was having some issues finding something for Christmas that was likely to catch his interest, since he\'s only partially interested in cars/dinosaurs/toys marketed at boys. I will update this after Christmas once he\'s played with it, but here\'s a review of my impressions as a parent.The toy looks quite odd. It\'s like nothing else that we have, but the design is very engaging, with colourful pieces, lights, sounds and a very, very simple interface at the basic level of operation - pieces-pit, play-stop. There is a colour-match element and a shape sorting element as all the pieces have different shapes colours and matching slots on the toy. But this is a toy with layers, so don\'t stop there.The 15 songs with which it is pre-programmed can be played by any combination of from 1 up to 6 of the 13 orchestra pieces. There are buttons that light up the instruments that will play harmony or melody (this changes song by song) if selected by the child, so you can have pure harmony (karaoke!), pure melody or a combination. I presently have it playing Beethoven\'s 5th for piano and guitar.Then, once you have cracked the instrumental sounds and the harmonic and melodic interface, you can start playing with tempo and then it gets silly, which is probably the bit the kids will like the most.There\'s a volume control, although the lowest is still quite loud and the loudest is bedroom-disco loud (which again they will love).Finally, whilst the music plays, relatively subtle lights in the pit flash in time to the music, with a colour for each of the instruments you have selected.So, it\'s now playing B.I.N.G.O.Read more › | Money well spent!!',5,3179,'2014-04-21'),(4978,'cd6672d7d54350d9c0815b53351a0f1e',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(4979,'20819b671ceb6f4aab5316caec8b02d1',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(4980,'52a658f0278ddb678d95b306c1298b89','Five Stars // 5.0 // 21 Feb. 2015 // By\n    \n    Jeni Trupia\n  \n on 21 Feb. 2015 // Great banner, just as ordered. | Five Stars',5,3141,'2015-05-22'),(4981,'7f6fc2835214450d6b5c4f95f0397250','Five Stars',5,1817,'2015-04-13'),(4982,'cf17c5fd8b99bb7ffe2b9ab507df3ff5','It did the job...... // 3.0 // 17 Nov. 2013 // By\n    \n    Countrystyle Lady\n  \n on 17 Nov. 2013 // I have not much to say here just that the banner was fixed to appropriate surfaces and served a purpose.It has been used once again but you do have to be careful when removing  as they split easily.I like the holographic ones as they do stand out, in my opinion anyway. | The quality is great, good print and looks great // 5.0 // 4 Oct. 2014 // By\n    \n    LMW\n  \n on 4 Oct. 2014 // I don\'t think it says in the description but it\'s 2.8 metres and the banner can be separated into 3 banners.

The questions are bang-up-to-date, the game is funky and fun - a refreshing modern twist on the great classic! Essentially you win card wedges by answering individual category cards correctly but in addition to this, you can use \'wild cards\' to stand in for a category of your choice - and the best bit is the \'steal\' or \'double steal\' cards which enable you to nick your opponents wedges! This makes the game more competetive and gives everyone a fair game meaning its not always the \'brain box\' that wins!!!!! The game is small enough to pack in your handbag, but on a negative note we found that after playing it for a couple of evenings we had worked our way through all the cards (although not every question on every card obviously)but this does limit its life span I guess. All in all I think its a fab game for holidays that offers lots of fun and for the price its virtually disposable when you\'ve exhausted the cards.

To live in another country. 2. To learn another language. 3. To make foreign friends. (Surely, 1 and 2 are the same?)But then there were great questions, which resulted in much hilarity from the players: Q: What do you like best: 1. Free drinks refills at restaurants. 2.

The designer is Rudiger Dorn, who also designed Goa, Genoa and Arkadia amongst others.Jambo is a trading game where players start with a small amount of money to invest in wares to display on there stalls to sell at a profit. The player with the most money at the end of a round when one player has reached 60 gold is the winner; so if Player 1 ends there turn on 60 gold, then Player 2 has a turn in which to exceed that total if they can.Players have 5 actions per turn in which to draw cards from a central deck and use action from equipment cards in front of them or to play cards from their hands to add goods to their market stalls or fulfil orders by playing cards and removing goods from their market stalls. What sounds like a grind is made tactical and highly interactive by the cards drawn from the deck that could be equipment for your own use, people cards who interact with both players to animals that have negative effects that can be played to your advantage if you are canny.

Plus they are quite educational, which also helps, as afterall if the child is having fun playing, they sometimes don\'t realise just how much knowledge they have gained, but ask a simple question about one of the Dogs a few days later and you will be amazed at just what they have picked up.They have been played with non-stop, I didn\'t play these with our daughter the first time they came out, and I have now seen what I have missed out on.  Even I have tried to play the game, you should try them!All we heard in the car on a very long journey were questions about the dogs, these were being asked backwards and forwards, I think I know more about the weights and different breeds of dogs than ever.  At least it stops the question of \'are we there yet?\'  I would glady buy another set of these cards (have noticed that there are different categories) as they really do stop the boredom from setting in, plus you don\'t need a table or surface, (could cut that time of boredom at the airport departure lounge, or anywhere else there is likely to be a delay).Great cheap stocking fillers and something that all ages can play, can get the more girlie type categories for girls, or the boyish ones, so basically something for everyone including adults. Useful to have in over the Christmas/summer holidays when people get together maybe of different ages, as age six to teenagers can play happily whilst the adults can talk or whatever.Read more › | Awful fish-eye lens pics of puppies // 1.0 // 26 Dec. 2013 // By\n    \n    Ilikespoons\n  \n on 26 Dec. 2013 // Each breed is represented by a photo of the puppy taken with a fish eye lens.

It\'s relatively easy for little ones to play, but that\'s not to say it isn\'t challenging. It\'s an enjoyable game that keeps my 3 year old daughter engaged - infact I\'m usually the first one that\'s ready to pack the game away!When you spin Peppa the Peppa Pig theme tune plays and Peppa chuckles \"Hee hee! Faster faster! Weee! This is fun!\" which my daughter finds hilarious. Plus when you switch the electronic spinner on Peppa says \"I\'m Peppa Pig\" and when you switch it off she says \"Bye bye\" which is very cute. I like the fact they have used Peppa\'s real voice.This game is not only fun, but is educational too. It\'s great for building memory skills and can also improve communication and social skills (naming the cards out loud, playing with others and learning to take turns). If the child doesn\'t concentrate and use their memory, they won\'t win the game - therefore my daughter has her eyes glued to the game whilst playing!The game can last quite a long time if you use all 24 cards, however you can shorten the game by removing cards which neither player has chosen - handy if you don\'t have much time on your hands or if your child is running low on patience!I recommend this game to all Peppa fans that are between the ages of 3-5 years - any younger and this game may be too challenging, any older and this game may be too easy/boring. | Great concept... // 2.0 // 26 Dec. 2009 // A Kid\'s Review\n  \n on 26 Dec. 2009 // The concept for this toy is great but we\'ve played it twice and would not rate it toy of the year 2009. The first time we played on the carpet so thought this might have played a factor in the toy not working according to instructions but we\'ve since played at the table and the same thing happened. Even once Peppa Pig has stopped spinning the music still continues as if she is still moving, admittedly this does not happen with every spin but more often than not. Maybe this problem will be rectified after a few plays with it,I don\'t wish to be negative however this has been our experince. | Good! // 4.0 // 6 Dec. 2009 // By\n    \n    D.

The game takes the format of a dungeon crawl where you bash down a door by turning over a \'Door\' card to reveal a monster, curse or other cards you can play. And with the slaying of monsters, you gain treasure by turning over \'Treasure\' cards which are usually helpful items such as \'Sneaky Bastard Sword\' or \'Yuppie Water\' for elves. You have cards that allow you to be various character classes such as cleric, thief, wizard or warrior, as well as races such as elf, halfling or dwarf, each with their special abilities. Your gender also has an effect too, as the Amazon will not fight female players, instead giving them treasure. And you can change these cards almost at any time, so that in the middle of combat you can say \"Forget being a dwarf warrior, I\'m now an elf thief!\".The great thing about this game is that even when it\'s not your turn, you have plenty of oppurtunities to play, since you can help somebody fight a monster (for a cut of the treasure of course, unless you were forced to fight by a magical item), steal from somebody else or curse somebody else.It\'s simple to learn and play is fast. You don\'t have to be a Dungeons and Dragons veteran to enjoy the game either, although you will understand the many in jokes if you are. I played the game with my wife and a friend who wouldn\'t go near a Dungeons and Dragons Players Handbook with a barge pole +5 and they both enjoyed the game.It says a game lasts an hour. The games I have played usually last longer, but that\'s probably because we spend so much time laughing at the amusing illustrations on each card as they are revealed.Highly recommended. | Good tongue in cheek entertainment',5,17,'2004-07-21'),(5370,'4818fa0c331c6f8f43c81fb4eacaf92c',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(5371,'a92b4b7e925b63df36022e519ca83ac3','Good set // 5.0 // 26 Oct. 2014 // By\n    \n    CycleRacing\n  \nHALL OF FAMETOP 50 REVIEWER on 26 Oct. 2014 // This is a lovely set of top trumps cards which any Frozen fan is bound to like.

It\'s portable and absorbing and never fails to be a popular option from both adults and children\'s points of view. It\'s simple but keeps all sorts of people interested in playing. We will certainly be investing in more of Gamewright\'s games. | Great fun even with a tantrummy six-year-old',5,2032,'2012-05-23'),(5389,'46d508b6ac61fd46f7f3e358d95eb179','Great pack of cards',5,1491,'2009-07-23'),(5390,'6e7a016815ec786dcaac0fd92ccb4321',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(5391,'5d9a3aa0d0a6346119660ab1b89eb016','Great cards // 5.0 // 31 Jan. 2014 // By\n    \n    Malcolm Williams\n  \n on 31 Jan. 2014 // Good service and cards were as a gift that made the recipient very happy.

The cards I was using were casino grade card, one pack cost around about 5GBP per pack and the other was around 8GBP. Both packs had been used for some games, but were still in pristine condition. In the space of a week I had wrecked the cheaper set with the more expensive set fairing better, but the edges were starting to separate. Both sets were permanently bent in the middle. Admittedly, I was making some mistakes and clashing edges against each other and roughly handling them as I bent them for a shuffle. I decided that I needed to invest in a more robust set of cards.I was reluctant to buy these due to the hefty 22 GBP price tag, thinking I could buy 4-5 sets for the same price, but I threw caution to the wind and I am glad I did. I have really put these cards through their pace. Bending half packs to almost 90 degrees as I shuffle them and after almost 2 weeks of 10 min per night shuffling they still look like new with almost no evidence of permanent bending.Whilst my shuffling had improved through the use of the paper based cards I was still making mistakes and clashing these together, but as they are one piece plastic/cellulose there are no edges to peel apart. They are a bit easier to bend and this reduces hand strain when constantly shuffling. The cards slide smoothly across each other which makes a big difference when bending them to go in for a shuffle - the paper based cards were starting to grind. The cards smooth surface allows the cards to space evenly and so as your thumb slides across the edge to release the card it is done fluidly and much more evenly.Read more › | The best playing cards // 5.0 // 10 Nov. 2011 // By\n    \n    Jo\n  \n on 10 Nov. 2011 // Kem plastic playing cards are worth paying the extra for as the are extremely hardwaring.

True to the product description, there were a good range of cards that filled up the booster box to the brim including a few uncommons and rares.I received cards from 4 or 5 different expansions, mainly from the later ones. As I had missed out on these later expansions, this was a great buy. I was slightly disappointed not to receive cards from the earliest expansions (expansions prior to 2000) but considering their rarity I didn\'t mind that much as I already had a majority of cards from them. Nearly all the cards come in mint/near mint condition with about 1% coming in a slightly worn/slightly played condition. You don\'t have to worry much about storage as all the cards fit very nicely into the booster box.This product is a great buy for beginners and collectors alike but some of the older MTG players will be disappointed not to receive cards from expansions prior to 2000. Of course it\'s an assorted selection so other people MIGHT get lucky and receive some older cards. Lastly, it\'s a great price! You get more for your money from buying this than you would if you bought the same amount in booster packs!Overall a very good product and great value for money. | Decent Variety, Much Repetition',2,121,'2014-04-19'),(5441,'500ce42658920763eda5144dff99bf17','Three Stars // 3.0 // 19 Mar. 2015 // By\n    \n    sean scorgie\n  \n on 19 Mar. 2015 // Heavy enough terible colour tho haha good feel to them | Five Stars',5,1840,'2015-07-22'),(5442,'6bae1a6f2a31e9108ccb521480f9932b',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(5443,'c7721ca112c97f769bec885b9c21ac7b',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(5444,'5e168c6d0ae3e74e75ab2618e0e52245',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(5445,'c98459322bdcbbfc372e711df30ceaa1','Top Quality Chess Board',5,1784,'2013-07-23'),(5446,'31f9c7ca22ebdb1371f4a3b9a9a11a2c',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(5447,'22abf8086d2d74de1fda5a7b0895864d','good size, heavy duty',4,3140,'2015-05-08'),(5448,'42686270405e444b6b5d5071fd13050d','Better than a coffee table book',5,248,'2013-07-14'),(5449,'fb8f595481597a9afe05d3d144e9a33f','Great present // 5.0 // 1 Nov. 2015 // By\n    \n    Marilyn W Griffiths\n  \n on 1 Nov. 2015 // Looks really good ...

He has started showing an interest in chess. He loves this chess set and he already understands the rules. The instructions that come with the set are more than enough to begin playing the game. The downside to the set is that the pieces fall over far to easily, despite the felt at the bottom, just a light touch knocks them all over. Also, down the left hand side of the board, it seems like there is a dark streak of varnish, i am not sure if this is part of the design, but the streak of varnish is darker compared to the rest of the board and it runs down the whole length down the board.

As a person who had never really ... // 4.0 // 12 Sept. 2014 // By\n    \n    Chris Hall\n  \n on 12 Sept. 2014 // Fantastic product. As a person who had never really played MTG before buying this it provided me with enough cards to happily make a playable deck of any colour, and I would totally recommend this product for any player novice or otherwise, and fully intend to buy the 2015 edition when it comes out next year. the only thing preventing me from giving it a full 5 stars are two complaints, one terribly minor, one sort of major.The minor one: The box I got was very much skewed towards green and black, with blue coming off the worst and it would be nice to have had more of a balance. I must stress that I still have plenty of blue cards and cards of other colours, but I certainly have more green and black than any other colour. I\'ve very recently bought a friend the box as a gift and I\'ve yet to find out if this is a common experience or just an anomaly.The slightly more major one: The rules cards that come in the box are very vague and myself and my flatmate played a few games with a very skewed view on how some of the more specific rules work and needed the help of a veteran friend to set us straight. I know that I could have checked the rules online, but we were completely unaware of the rules that we were taking in the wrong way.To reiterate I completely think this is a fantastic, if not very very very slightly flawed package, and the fact that I bought another one for a friend should stand testament to my support for the product.You dig magic: The Gathering, or want to get into it?

The engine wash needs to be clipped in position on the track before it can be played with, but this is straight forward enough.You then put Percy in the entrance on the engine wash, push the button on the roof and the rollers pull him through.Now for the downsides...If you have any other take n play sets, you probably already have at least one Percy.Smaller engines like Thomas, Edward and even Henry go through the engine wash well, but chunky ones like Spencer, Toby, and carriages Annie and Clarabel are too wide to be pulled through. And taller engines like Gordon and James go through the rollers ok, but the roof of their driver cabs get stuck on something near the exit of the engine wash so it\'s a little tricky to get them out.All of the other take n play pieces we have (Thomas and Friends Take-n-Play Cranky At The Docks Playset, Thomas and Friends Take-n-Play Tidmouth Sheds Playset, Thomas and Friends Knapford Station) fold up really neatly and fairly easily. This set requires you to unclip the engine wash, fold the track and then slot the engine wash over the top. In my experience, this process is too much of a faff, so I never do it. Consequently the set doesn\'t fold up as satisfactorily as the others do.Quite a fun piece, and I would have liked to have rated it at 3.5 stars but still hasn\'t knocked Cranky off the top spot as best part of the range. | Good addition to other sets // 4.0 // 6 Jan. 2012 // By\n    \n    A.

The engine wash set is a good addition to extend the track but would I imagine be a bit boring on its own. My daughter finds it difficult to get some of her other engines to move through the wash, some don\'t fit very well e.g. Emily and James are a bit tall, although the Percy engine which comes with the wash play set goes through ok, the button on the top of the wash can be difficult sometimes as you have to press it firmly then release several times to get the momentum. That said it doesn\'t bother her and she can get her hand in the other end of the wash to pull any stuck engines out! | Fantastic.',5,1103,'2012-05-11'),(5750,'2bf0d88f6c1c0c1b33590b00cc10c660','KATO TRAM SET',5,2316,'2014-04-05'),(5751,'ea46926383b95214e6dd9652f70e8322',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(5752,'b07f8bc34ff88672b18f2ee8f03f3b55','Five Stars',5,1289,'2015-05-31'),(5753,'72dd741c74cbfa2b2dec3530bb0f8c1b',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(5754,'1a02aab9e3f11bbc8903053191efb519',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(5755,'e99f252daed95f9a84d96414ed8b1a1c',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(5756,'661899fc42d0c89cf92b734a96e8d0ba',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(5757,'523b9da55606acf9afc64340cac6d3e0',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(5758,'33cc2b88d9bf8f46f2e569fa5606c337',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(5759,'2edf279943e1026522ee94545133e2af','Excellent Product // 5.0 // 22 Aug. 2013 // By\n    \n    Mrs A Power\n  \n on 22 Aug. 2013 // Had been trying to find a Polar express set for my little boy for over a year as he is obsessed with the film & trains in general.

He absolutely loved it and was a total hit on his birthday.  Has plenty of track pieces and easy operation of switch tracks.  I wasn’t overly impressed with the so called ‘auto loader’, as it’s not physically attached to the relevant track piece, it just kind of floats free.  However, the auto stop feature works very well.  The trains can be a little fiddly to couple together and keep on the track at times, but are more than robust enough to withstand a 4 year old.  After a few hours he was swapping the train cars around and easily putting them back on the track when they became derailed.  The actual train motor has two speeds on it. Allowing for easier play and longer battery life (when it’s going slower).  Battery life using a mix of both speeds was easily 6 hours. | 5 yr old likes this // 4.0 // 9 Jan. 2014 // By\n    \n    Becky\n  \n on 9 Jan. 2014 // My 5 yr old really wanted this when saw it on the telly so we got it for him for xmas.

I can only assume others have not got the knack of getting the track to clip together properly (there is a knack to it).I would highly recommend this to anyone.

And the sugar shaker is adorable and this absolutely made it all the more fun, after scooping up sand onto the cone, selecting a shell for a cherry, a pebble for the 99 flake, my kids then saw the shaking of sugar/sprinkles on top as the best bit.

There are some very small pieces with this set so if the person that you are buying this set for has a baby brother or sister please beware. | A must for Playmobil and dinosaur fans // 5.0 // 17 Sept. 2015 // By\n    \n    Red Rose Mummy\n  \n on 17 Sept. 2015 // We\'re dinosaur, and Playmobil crazy in our house so this was an essential addition to our collection when we purchased it for our five year old son. This is one of the smaller sets in the Playmobil range and features a Dimetrodon (it all works well with the scale of the Playmobil sets which are all at the same scale so it\'s smaller than the other dinosaurs because Dimetrodon was smaller). The set arrives with a range of accessories including a snake, flying lizard, butterfly and dragonfly. You also receive a water pool and vegetation which you will need to construct prior to play.Some of the pieces are rather small so it\'s important to make sure that you have good storage for the toy when it\'s been unboxed. The Playmobil boxes don\'t reseal so these don\'t work in that way for us. It\'s also important to keep the smaller pieces away from younger siblings who might be tempted to put them in their mouths.My son has been delighted with this set and he can be found playing with his collection often. I\'d really recommend it for dinosaur and Playmobil fans. | Good value // 4.0 // 20 Oct. 2013 // By\n    \n    Andrea\n  \n on 20 Oct. 2013 // Bought for my 3 year old son. He loves it.

The Giganotosaurus lives up to its name and towers over every other dinosaur in my four-year-old son\'s collection. It\'s big in a way that defines bigness. The wee 1/48th scale man (a nice touch) that comes with it is 1.5 inches tall, and barely reaches this thing\'s ankle joint. Despite the size, the model is well finished and beautifully balanced: it really does stand there on two legs and menace everything that comes near it. The plastic (vinyl?) also seems to be as tough as old boots, as it has survived all kinds of small boy treatment. And apart from being a splendid dinosaur, \"Mister Giganotosaurus\" (and being able to say that has educational value all on its own) has also become the terror of \"baddy\" knights and Airfix 1/32nd soldiers, and has been incorporated into most games and lots of imaginative play.An excellent buy, then. | Fantastic to the last detail // 5.0 // 23 Jun. 2012 // By\n    \n    chlo n\n  \n on 23 Jun. 2012 // Love this model so much...

The figure comes nicely packaged which is colourful and easy to open and release the figure from.  Mr. Conductor stands just shy of 8 inches.Sculpt: The figure is very accurate to the tv show character; it’s immediately recognisable. The materials are mostly plastic but the arms are rubber, being the thinnest part of the toy this is just as well to prevent snapped limbs.  The figure lacks in texture being just glossy plastic with no dinosaur skin look which the show’s character does have and indeed so do other toys in the series.Mr. Conductor is held together by screws and unfortunately no effort has been made to blend them in, they are unpainted, silver and tend to stand out especially the two that affix the jaw, giving the toy a Frankenstein-esque appearance; now the majority of kids won’t really mind but I still think it’s sloppy and makes the figure look a little cheap.Articulation: for this figure involves the mouth, which is opened by pressing a button on top of the head, the neck which pivots backwards and forwards, arms rotate up and down and legs rotate also.Special Features: Mr. Conductor says various phrases from the tv series when you press down firmly on the head button or when you press the button on his chest (this is supposed to be his pocket watch but has no real watch detail). Pressing the pocket watch also causes it to flash different colours. He has 3 settings which can be changed by using a switch on his side, 2 of these settings change the language between English and Spanish and the 3rd enables a SFX mode where he will roar, yawn or giggle when buttons are pressed.  If the figure is not played with for some minutes it will snore briefly.Read more › | Grand Daughter just loves it. // 5.0 // 16 Dec. 2014 // By\n    \n    Mike Nicholson\n  \n on 16 Dec. 2014 // Purchased for our Grand daughter for her 6th birthday and she just loves it.Mr Conductor probably interacts more than any other Dinosaur, and sings the theme tune too.Can recommend this to any child who enjoys the Dinosaur train. | Great toy, best toy brought for a while! // 5.0 // 26 Jun. 2014 // By\n    \n    billie-jo allen\n  \n on 26 Jun. 2014 // My son love this character and I had to get it for him.

The instrument is perfectly pitched to 4 fixed notes, which allow children to play a couple of recognisable tunes easily, and the packaging includes finger maps to show them how to play these. I also agree with company\'s claim that the sound has been designed deliberately so as to not be annoying - in fact it\'s quite pleasing to the ear and not too loud (much better than so many other musical toys out there, that one ends up hiding away in the furthest cupboard). If you have a child who is musically inclined but too young yet to learn a real instrument, I really recommend this. It improves coordination and introduces children to the notion of being able to play real tunes with an instrument (rather than just random sound collections), and to the concept of how to follow some kind of score.Overall, this is a really nice quality toy, which I would wholeheartedly recommend. | toy ok, childs effort less so // 3.0 // 4 Dec. 2010 // By\n    \n    spitfire\n  \n on 4 Dec. 2010 // my little boy told me he wanted a trumpet for his birthday, so i looked around and this seemed the best \"cheap\" trumpet as i didnt want to spend money if he never used it. it was fine and although plastic seems quite robust and the notes are defined. it only came with 2 little colour note music charts, neither of which i had heard of. it would be nice if there had been a little booklet of tunes to play, preferably ones which are recognised tunes.So, he blew it for a bit (quite irritating) and then forgot about it and went back to his train set. still, he was happy to get the birthday present he wanted and thats what matters. | Great toy',5,2022,'2009-05-18'),(6297,'fc4af70fec125caf373079b5125d24fb','Five Stars // 5.0 // 13 Jan. 2015 // By\n    \n    Pete Gase\n  \n on 13 Jan. 2015 // Perfect | Five Stars',5,946,'2015-07-21'),(6298,'69d23754e63705122e21453ad37cb7f8','Really good, bought 3 and have used them as a ...',5,2751,'2015-04-30'),(6299,'147a477099148b2e1363623895d91231','Banner. // 5.0 // 26 Nov. 2013 // By\n    \n    MS\n  \n on 26 Nov. 2013 // Used for our aunt\'s special 100th birthday party.

Watt\n  \n on 7 Mar. 2009 // Back in the 1980s when Transformers began, there was a character called Hound who was the Autobot scout type character.  He had highly advanced sensor detection systems within himself and he loved learning of Earth\'s culture.Also another character was introduced, though he didn\'t relaly get a general speaking part until Beast Wars over ten years later.  The character was Ravage, a Decepticon spy who turned into an audio cassette and slotted into Soundwave\'s chest compartment.Hound was never really seen again after the 80s until the Alternators/Binal Tech lines came and he received a 21st century remake in the form of, well, a jeep.He would later receive another version, again as a jeep, in the second release of the Classics/Universe line as a Legends class and now he\'s back once again, as a jeep, and as a deluxe.  And Ravage comes with him.So jeep and kitty for the price of the jeep, not bad.  So on with the review:Hound alt mode:  This mode is mostly in one colour, a mid coloured green.  The small hatch where his windscreen is attached is a lighter shade of green.  Other colours used are a small red for the AUtobot symbol on the front, a gun grey front roll bar, a black used for the front grill, under carridge, wheels, back seats, which aren\'t even seats, tabs on the back and dashboard.A dark green is used at the back behind the seats, the seat themselves are white, the two main ones anyway. And the side skirts are a gun grey, the windscreen is tinted a soft blue as are his headlights with a little yellow on the indicator lights on the front and red used for the brake lights on the back, his weapon/hologram projector is a light green and silver.The colours work well for this mode and the mode looks great.Read more › | A Damn fine toy',5,1960,'2010-07-10'),(6368,'4c2c641c7ea6129d6a925f4a49375022',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(6369,'60ec75fec191895596e83c1875cdadea',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(6370,'6248b000693bad3777d55ae281b7e90c',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(6371,'b615541679933d1ab7c988ea42c6b538',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(6372,'4f4c701a599fb0b34542b33be45c7797',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(6373,'85efc1bd47759800c5a68864c17c32ee','Robosapien Robot',5,2002,'2010-07-24'),(6374,'56d264fb0535320bcdb2b3d7ebbdb247',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(6375,'5ecdcd59dae77fcfc24d973caab17036',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(6376,'d318d525e7f768c770963b96ce5fd8e2',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(6377,'da6833db94593fe965783ae26ff0e944','This is not  \'Ironhide\'',5,2240,'2007-07-30'),(6378,'c8ad3bbfea9b420e7de995415a1fa615','Love those Droids! // 5.0 // 24 Aug. 2012 // By\n    \n    trooper1879\n  \n on 24 Aug. 2012 // Great set of droids from a great moment in The Phantom Menace where we get introduced to the ever lovable R2-D2and his starship R2 friends who sadly dont last very long, best left in the box the quality of these so calledbattle packs is a tad below what you would get in a figure as a single however togther they are great, and who does,nt love R2-D2!

He named this one Transformer Tony Grimobot. He played all afternoon and looks forward to his next visit.This is a sturdy action figure, and is available for all sorts of modes. I could not figure it out, but this eight year old did without any problems. If your child has a vivid imagination,than this transformer you is for them.Recommended. prisrob 05-26-14 | Present for 7 year old',4,329,'2014-04-06'),(6520,'a4a34702690555b33e44c7fa3b5681e6','love it // 5.0 // 20 Dec. 2014 // By\n    \n    daniel jones.\n  \n on 20 Dec. 2014 // great i always wanted one but could never find one and finding this was great the phrases from the film and blaster sound are good anyone who loves star wars then this is a perfect collectors piece. | An Executive Toy?',3,325,'2015-05-23'),(6521,'7eb06fbfb45dfc998ef9c6a05eef8008',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(6522,'3dccc13f7d25813e074d411e0dd834c3',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(6523,'7f5f45086abda984bd646858aeb515dc',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(6524,'adf566a3c15d33df796a1d142fa947ed','Good for Clone Wars fan',4,2113,'2015-04-18'),(6525,'3c1c6afb2551f1534d80c760e26127c6','The kids love it // 5.0 // 23 Feb. 2014 // By\n    \n    Milly_99\n  \n on 23 Feb. 2014 // My Star Wars crazy kids love this edition of Angry Birds STar Wars.

It is time to meet John Reid - a masked hero known as the Lone Ranger. Wow! // 5.0 // 20 Jun. 2013 // By\n    \n    RICHARD HILL\n  \n on 20 Jun. 2013 // Well I think that the seven inch figure of the Lone Ranger is a brilliant purchase to own because the figure is perfectly detailed such as from the head sculpt of the actor Armie Hammer. Naturally, it is even more detailed on his cowboy clothing such as his Texas Ranger badge, his black pointy boots, his belt, his black gloves, a white shirt to his blue waistcoat, his black mask, his red cowboy neck scarf, his light brown hair, his brown trousers attaching to his two holsters in place, to the detail of his size of appearance. Having said that, I still think that it is a brilliant figure. His accessories are brilliant because you are not only getting the figure by himself you are also getting a cream cowboy hat and even two revolvers. Once you have the seven inch Lone Ranger NECA figure in your collection you can put his revolvers inside his holsters. The reason why I say that is because you have got to keep them safe otherwise you might lose them such as on the floor. His articulation is brilliant because you can turn his head up and down his arms going around three hundred and sixty degrees, bending ninety degrees at his elbow, and ball hinged swivel wrists. Moving down, there is limited articulation in his waist because they are hindered by his holsters. However, his legs go backwards and forwards so does his thighs and there is an up and down movement in his black pointy boots. So, apart from the detail and the articulation of this figure I still think that the value of £15.87 is a good recommendation. Even though it is a quite a bit of money you would still have to earn a treat such as doing your schoolwork at home or by helping out at school.Read more › | Brilliant figure // 5.0 // 29 Aug. 2013 // By\n    \n    Hillas ;-D\n  \n on 29 Aug. 2013 // I bought this figure for my son\'s birthday and he has had hours of fun with it.It\'s great for all those \'Lone Ranger\' fans. | Hi Ho Silver and away',5,2299,'2013-07-19'),(6538,'291dba20ee9b038f63ff04ec0b940968',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(6539,'0a2f23a77e2e59ac8899f8156a398c80',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(6540,'7de5957e2de1f926d0569abe6d24463b',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(6541,'d99f18b2e1620d73f2914b1fb29ec729',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(6542,'1202d7300588d173d2e2264f71cae7de',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(6543,'caaaf15d63eb96a7682ccb5887cad19c',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(6544,'f689671f877ef1d5130764ad57444503',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(6545,'4c5584f6982194d31babe77b975b4183',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(6546,'1d45433b573bcfc4caa418bb7330901d','\"Hello, there!\" // 3.0 // 19 Aug. 2015 // By\n    \n    Stefan\n  \n on 19 Aug. 2015 // Definately not great for playing with, the Quad-arms struggle to hold the lightsabers at all.If however you plan on having this guy on a shelf, then you should be able to position him with ease, and he does look great!

However, I actually bought them to add some sparkle to my home made computer greetings cards at Christmas.I wasn\'t expecting them to work as well as the traditional glue on paper, sprinkle glitter, shake off method but they actually worked much better.The easy to hold pen design allows for greater definition and control for the placement of lovely sparkly glitter. They come in some really beautiful colours and once dry (takes about 2 hours or so to be totally dry) can create some stunning effects.

You can hold it exactly like a Biro and have maximum control. The nib is small so you can fit a lot of writing in if you have a small white board. It even comes with an eraser on the end. I have been using it for 4 months now and it is still going. Remarkably the eraser is still working too. I thought it would run out of use fairly quickly as it is not that big, but it is great.

He has produced some magnificent posters for science, history and geography as well as his favourite hobby of cartooning. He even looks after them and puts them away afterwards which is a first. The pens blend well, are easy to handle and the colours are vibrant. I would definitely recommend investing in these over any number of cheaper felt tip colours for the same cost. The pens will bleed through standard paper and mark the surface underneath so either invest in a good quality ream of A3 or make sure that your table is otherwise protected.

Will be ordering more for sure. | They are NOT Toys // 5.0 // 11 Dec. 2011 // By\n    \n    Mr. Michael Smith\n  \n on 11 Dec. 2011 // These are not your average Felt-Tip pens. The price might lead you to that conclusion anyway. They originated as - and still are - professional tools for Graphic Designers who were / are familiar with Letraset\'s Pantone (R) colours, which were the standard for Print. These are serious Artist\'s tools, (hence the \'Pro\' in the name perhaps) and are manufactured with that in mind. So don\'t buy these if all you want to do is block-fill the inside of the black lines in a child\'s colouring book. The ink is specially formulated and the Blending Pen is a useful tool for avoiding having to purchase other Pens in intermediate spectrum colours. The Blending pen needs to be cleaned to eradicate unwanted colour that it will accumulate.Letraset\'s original Pantone Markers (single tip) and their follow-up \"TRIA\" format (with 3 standard, ultra-fine and wedge tips) also had the option of using a specifically-designed Airbrush attachment. Although the Pens here look exactly like the Tria, I don\'t know if they are tooled to fit the Airbrush adaptor for the Tria range, but I\'m sure I\'ll soon find out. The adaptor is one of my prized possessions. It may be long out of production, so might be worth quite a bit :-)Durability: When used sparingly, for their intended purpose, they can last almost a lifetime. I have 3 original Pantone Markers which I\'ve had since 1975 and even though I\'ve used them sparingly they all work perfectly today. (2011)Educational: They do offer more realistic and subtle colour options with which to work. If a 12 pen set - all grey - makes you scratch your head, then they will help in teaching a child to look at colours in real life and to use the pens to realise shadings, tones and such.

As such, they can be purchased at most decently-connected art shops, and are by no means unique to this producer. That said, the price is quite good (regular paint markers can run up to 4.95 GBP each), the colors are strong, and the application easy. I can\'t really think of any negatives here at all, although the panel-liner is a felt-tip that doesn\'t have a great deal of precision; I prefer using a 0.02 mechanical pencil. If anybody here hasn\'t used a paint marker before, all you need to do is shake one firmly until the clear tip turns colored, then apply -lightly- to the surface of your choice. Pressing too hard will only result in splashing the paint, ruining the kind of delicate finish these markers were designed to produce. Soft single strokes that all go in the same direction will result in the best finish, in my experience. | Limited use so far // 3.0 // 7 Jan. 2014 // By\n    \n    Philip\n  \n on 7 Jan. 2014 // I haven\'t got much use out of these yet.

The first was the Tangle Relax, and I\'ll compare this one to my Relax.This Tangle is durable.  The Tangle Relax has a rubbery (but not sticky) texture, this Tangle is made of hard plastic.  I still love the Relax, and I bought a replacement for it, but it\'s not going to last forever. I assumed that would be the case when I bought it.  If long-term durability is important for you, this one is better.This Tangle is easy to keep clean.  I love the way the Relax feels, but it\'s surface makes it less than ideal at times.  It would get dirty, and after awhile, it started looking permanently dirty.  This one is better for taking out and about, shoving in pockets or purses, and for places with lots of germs.This Tangle stays posed.  I don\'t know how to explain it, but the Relax is floppy.  You don\'t even have to shake it to get it to lose it\'s form.  This Tangle can be posed and will stay put.This Tangle doesn\'t necessarily match the picture.  This is a big deal for some, and not a big deal for others.  I enjoyed the surpise, but others may want something more specific.  Also, if you want \"girl\" colours or \"boy\" colours, there are other sellers who offer that.This Tangle doesn\'t lay flat.  The Relax comes with exactly 20 pieces, and you can put it in shapes that lay perfectly flat.  This one has 18 pieces, so I\'d either have to remove two pieces or buy a second and add two peices to make it lay flat.Buying a second might be a good idea anyway.  If this is your first Tangle, be prepared for people to ask to hold it and play with it.  This always drives me a bit crazy, and I like having a \"backup\" when possible.

He\'s already made his own little collection of cars without any instructions. He has also followed the diagrams and built toys from the book which he was thrilled with.The instructions are simple and easy to follow with plenty of pictures and are brilliant for giving kids the freedom to learn on their own.The box lid is rarely on as he\'s constantly rummaging through it for that \'one little piece he needs\' so it\'s a massive relief to see him enjoying it so much.The only concern I have is for the clumsy parents who will no doubt stand on the pieces when they\'re left lying around!Brilliant product and when my little boy is old enough, I will be back in the market for something VERY similar, if not, the same item.Recommended. | Fantastic Model Building Set // 5.0 // 19 Feb. 2015 // By\n    \n    Capri1\n  \n on 19 Feb. 2015 // This is the 2nd set I have bought of this set to augment the two other K\'Nex sets my grandson has.  It is worth knowing the box is not full, you get a lot of pieces but not enough to make all of the models on the box unless each model is dismantled to make another, hence the reason for another purchase. The pieces are made of good quality material non have been broken yet.  My grandson (aged 8) loves K\'Nex and he makes his own models without using the instructions.

This is a great set size, and comes with so many different kind of models to make that it\'s enjoyable for people and children who enjoy following instructions.Instructions are clear and easy to understand. It comes with about 600 pieces, and little kits grouped together for various projects.The \"pros\" are several:- Easy to follow instructions- Pictorial illustrations in the manual are very good- Pieces are very sturdy- You can make multiple toys from all the pieces in the box- Stimulates the imagination, encouraging children to \"engineer\" their own projectsWe can\'t think of any \"cons\" except that children younger than 7 may need some assistance at first, with clipping the pieces together and following the manual instructions.The product is priced well considering the amount of pieces and items that you can build, and is a nice change from Lego\'s and other commonplace sets.Highly recommended... | Poor instructions, only 12 models included, 217 other pages online only // 1.0 // 21 Jun. 2015 // By\n    \n    parisian99\n  \n on 21 Jun. 2015 // It\'s potentially a good set which can make 52 models as long as you take it apart after each model.  The problem I have is that Knex are too cheap to include a proper instruction booklet - the booklet supplied only has the instructions for 12 out of the 52 models. You are supposed to go online to download the rest.  I\'ve just done that and the other instructions are in 8 different pdf documents with a total of 217 pages!There\'s no point printing them off unless it\'s in colour and depending on your tablet not that easy to see on a small screen.  This makes it impossible for my boys to access the instructions or browse the models independently - I will have to set it up on the tablet for them.I would have expected a set that advertises itself as able to make 52 models actually includes the instructions for those 52 models in the box.Poor show, knex - I will be wary about other purchases from them. | Keeps them quiet for hours!',5,1886,'2015-07-22'),(6879,'f492d97fbad2c74b17e0039e5e5db545',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(6880,'bf773c2b79532d560a3dce3be340a027',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(6881,'7285f818f1784aa79d095bcc6e219a1a',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(6882,'459e04367bc66260158f4f909c488359','A great buy // 5.0 // 11 Oct. 2011 // By\n    \n    Bluebelle\n  \n on 11 Oct. 2011 // Bought for my 7 year old son, made by my 12 year old daughter!

And I’m pretty excited! I had seen the video review of this set a few days back and liked it. Then , I decided to take it. Today I saw it in a local store and bought it immediately (though there were a LOT of other new LEGO sets).  And This set is MUCH better than I thought I would be and I’m pretty Happy!The BEST part about this set is of course the Minifigs. I’m NOT much of a “Star Wars” fan…but I’m a HUGE LEGO fan…mostly because of minifigs! And THAT’s the reason I took this set. Beaufitul minifigs! This set contains 4 Utapau  troopers. Two are the Para-troopers ( both exactly the same ) and the other two are the 212th clone-troopers (both,  also, exactly the same)  The printings on their Torsos and legs are VERY good. (Generally, LEGO doesn’t do much printing on the legs on the minifig but here it’s done it, so good). Their helmets are MAGNIFICIENT! Two different kinds of helmets in this set! And each is FANTASTIC. Good markings and design on both the helmets. (One minor complaint I have about LEGO is that they NEVER do side printing on torsos of the minifigs and I feel it looks weird. Hope someday LEGO will start doing it).One VERY GOOD thing about this set are the NEW blasters from LEGO..This year , it’s the first time LEGO has introduced such blasters! This is my FIRST set where I’m seeing these blasters. And guess what? THEY REALLY FIRE! YES! There’s a very simple and awesome mechanism in this blaster, where you can fire a stud. And it travels a pretty decent speed! Though it’s a play feature for kids, adults are also going to equally enjoy it!! Just put a blaster in one minifig, put another one in front of it , shoot the blaster ..and BLAM! The other minifg is down. Just do it!

It was bought as a new holiday toy for 10 & 12 yr old stepsons who like both Lego & POTC, so it was a hit; also they managed to build this as per instructions without any help, I find modern Lego instructions very clear & straightforward. I did buy the blue Lego baseboard aswell, to be a bigger \'sea\', as there are hardly any blue plates in this. The minifigs are good, the moving parts add interest, and the many little accessories are lovely.

One reason being that he is a great Lego fan plus he thought the picture on the box made the item look good fun.Well the set has been used along with the other sets from the same range (pirates).  You don\'t need to get all the other sets to have hours of fun, a this set has lots of parts that move and can be made into various combinations.The best bit was the money (lego money) according to our son, along with the island with the skeleton.Must say that no pieces have been broken yet or lost, and the other smaller pieces from the same range (some under five pound) have been combined with this Island set.I think the best thing with Lego is that you don\'t have to buy all the expensive parts to have fun, as even the less priced items are well made and give hours of fun for lego lovers whatever their ages. | A little bit of fun // 4.0 // 27 Sept. 2011 // By\n    \n    Happyfamily\n  \n on 27 Sept. 2011 // I bought this because my 9 year-old wanted to play with the characters, the rest was a useful bonus.

A lot of the gold coind have got lost (or vaccuumed up), but i dont think that\'s an issue with the toy, more of an issue with a 5yr old child who doesn\'t put things away!So if you like Lego and you like Pirates, this set ticks both boxes and yo uwont be disapointed | pirates // 5.0 // 5 Oct. 2011 // By\n    \n    maggiemo\n  \n on 5 Oct. 2011 // Present for a 8 year old - loves the game.

His older brother has a lot of the old Bionicle figures and he loves playing with those. This was one of the figures he received. He doesn\'t do a lot of lego type builds on his own and usually gets his big brother to help, but the instructions were very detailed and my 6 year old managed to put the figure together all by himself. These figures do come in the bag, which is a good sturdy bag and comes with picture instructions that show step by step how it goes together. It is surprisingly sturdy and the pieces are well built (many are obviously injection molded pieces but the plastic is quite hard but remains lightweight) my only concern are the smaller pieces with a little one picking them up, but once the pieces are in place, besides weapons etc they do tend to stick in quite well. I would recommend for a fan of lego or hero factory. They are good fun and are larger than an action figure when built. Typically theyre around 9\"-12\" tall, depending on which one it is.

The Boulder Blaster actually fires it\'s missiles by you turning the wheel on either side of it once built and this has given lots of fun (and lots of searching for the missiles under the sofa etc!) and is another brilliant set from Lego.The set comes with three figures; Cole, Zugu and Sleven and each has their weapons too - Cole\'s jagged blades, Sleven\'s dagger and Zugu\'s Anacondrai Blade.  Zugu has a clip on shoulder piece which has a skeletal back to it and pointed bones on the shoulders and Zugu also has his skull helmet.  Sleven has a skull helmet and Cole has his black Ninja headpiece.The main plane comes in two different numbered bags and the instruction book takes you through step by step to complete the Boulder Blaster. The Boulder Blaster has a handle to help when flying it around, the cockpit opens for Cole to sit inside, the little side wings can be moved up and down and of course it actually fires the eight missiles!The set also comes with a little Anacondrai outpost which your child can smash over using the Boulder Blaster and missiles and so the play value of this set is fantastic.The Boulder Blaster measures approx 8cm high by 28cm long by 20cm wide to the edges of the wings and the instructions are really easy to follow.  The little Anacondrai outpost measures approx 6cm wide by 4cm deep by 4cm high.This is another brilliant set from Lego and a fantastic addition to the Ninjago range or even as a stand alone set by itself and if I could give the set more than 5 stars I would as the Boulder Blaster and firing missiles feature is fantastic. | really good set. // 5.0 // 21 Mar. 2015 // By\n    \n    victoria dowson\n  \n on 21 Mar. 2015 // buyed this for my 9 year old son as he is a big lego ninjago  fan , he loved it, I would buy from here again and this would be a good set for all lego ninjago fans. | Great Lego set',5,2845,'2015-04-27'),(6909,'90eba2cb57345cc859dc25cec5d782a1','Snape\'s Potions Class // 5.0 // 29 Oct. 2001 // By\n    \n    A Customer\n  \n on 29 Oct. 2001 // Being a huge fan of Professor Snape I couldn\'t resist buying this particular Lego set, and I wasn\'t disappointed.

There is also a nice mechanism in the side that, with the turn of an axle, opens the rear doors and allows access to the inside where there is a sliding seat platform with room for one figure.The best thing about the kit is really the five figures that come with it. There are 2 standard B1 Battle Droids, both armed with black blaster rifles and an OOM series Pilot Droid to fly the ship.For the first time we also have the treacherous Nemoidian Nute Gunray and the Rodian ambassador Onaconda Farr. Both are great figures and a welcome addition to the Lego universe.The shuttle is 19.5 cm long, 9.5 cm wide (at the landing legs) and 17.5 cm tall.The kit comprises 234 pieces (not including figures and weapons), there are 7 decals to apply and construction time is about 20 minutes.A nice little ship and worth it just for the figures. | lego star wars // 5.0 // 28 Jun. 2010 // A Kid\'s Review\n  \n on 28 Jun. 2010 // I got this shuttle for a present for my hard work.I was a bit worried about some review about it being fragile in some places.These reviews were wrong because if you put it together properly it is not fragile at all.proswell put togetherminifiguresgood instuctionsconsneeds more minifigures.could have some clones or super battle droidshope this is helpfullJames smith age 11 | Thoroughly enjoyed. // 5.0 // 24 Aug. 2014 // By\n    \n    Mrs C\n  \n on 24 Aug. 2014 // This was given as a gift.

Unlike when I was a kid, kids nowadays don\'t typically play with random bricks and use their imagination to create something that is a likeness of something - but not as accurate as the sets make. I\'ve been encouraging this more and we play games of who can create something the most original from the lego we have. I purchased this set as we have a family friend who had this set for their child and I was impressed with the variety. As we have themed lego sets, alot of our lego is the same shapes and colours. This set has a wide variety of different shapes, sizes, colours etc. The box is really cool, but I would prefer if the sides were plastic as it would make the box more robust and something that will last as storage for lego for a longer time. The lid is plastic and is ideal. The outside shows all of the pieces included. As you can see from the pictures - the majority of the pieces are quite small. This is both a good and bad thing. Some of the smaller pieces are scarcer in themed sets and are a nice extra detail when creating various objects using your imagination. It also means that this set in itself isnt ideal if you want to make a variety of random things without instructions. There are instructions to make little things like cows and a little house etc. but this set is limited to using your imagination and really is better as an extra to an already existing collection. Having said that the box is an impressive size, but once the lego is out of the bag it just covers the bottom of the box. I got this for 9.00 and was quite happy with that.Read more › | great for my left hand dexterity',5,1828,'2015-05-05'),(6925,'f9e60eb8f11de2dc3c4dfdb894146244',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(6926,'3079686388297bdcc9f5aee1737f99ce',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(6927,'c38d076c5a950b8c63066e9f06ac54ad','Kit arrived in about two weeks of ordering and was ... // 5.0 // 4 Feb. 2015 // By\n    \n    Neilyboy79\n  \n on 4 Feb. 2015 // Kit arrived in about two weeks of ordering and was kept up to date via email on delivery ,kit itself makes up to be an empresive model ,I wanted this kit to work along side my Leopold railway gun which I will be making a rather large diorama out of with different German military vehicles around , | Fabulous kit... up to the usual Trumpeter ... // 5.0 // 22 Dec. 2014 // By\n    \n    Ray Worth\n  \n on 22 Dec. 2014 // Fabulous kit...up to the usual Trumpeter high standards. | Five Stars',5,2120,'2015-04-17'),(6928,'b442ec03fdaa2dbf8c92a31b9dd26d17',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(6929,'10a81f97df1805e6d85a39f51a8d0000',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(6930,'cc01d883cc64135d8e97adf0f6464e64',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(6931,'fd8948362aa0a5c5f50d0025799b8066','Hawkeye',1,42,'2014-04-24'),(6932,'5b640865def009d77022ae993bb0f423',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(6933,'48c102b8fb4d36079abeb69735ec59f0',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(6934,'2dfbf9263fe1cdc1d60677aad142d2c9',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(6935,'da242bed98ed978db00acd38c8a71f40',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(6936,'3ecb2e87250a4139f7f171f72dfc39ea','Overpriced // 3.0 // 11 Feb. 2013 // By\n    \n    suzanne\n  \n on 11 Feb. 2013 // I was amazed at how small the figures were for £20-00.

He looks huge and grotesque and well ugly. Unlike the other figures he has slightly different construction because of his size he has no head rotation his torso and head are all one piece he does have a waist cut giving him rotation there. also the has wrist swivel elbow joints and shoulder joints. he comes with two accessories his Crown which is removable it sits ontop his head via a small peg. and the huge staff or club. I will say this this guy may be more suitable for older kids as this guy may give younger ones nightmares. all in all an amazingly well detailed and fairly sturdy toy. defiantly worth getting this set for the collector | Hobbit figures',5,2633,'2013-04-17'),(7032,'d5fd89373a72807bb15626db40d6e9ac',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(7033,'85c21a29bb323a96ef4e652a17ac3358',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(7034,'dcd45262c5e20271ad5acce568899332',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(7035,'c485b171c2dfbc7c3fe57f2358597f67',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(7036,'308ee37435bb457b11611dbada144c1a','A nice ship, but it comes with a high points cost',5,303,'2015-05-05'),(7037,'7cdf088d04b0107120567285a18b7280',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(7038,'2dfa16beee4c487fb13a2e68723e160a',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(7039,'15ddbba435102d70eb29ee33a3ee892b','Beware the base!',4,3154,'2015-04-05'),(7040,'a44bb79d058efc8b9d1214480d126692',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(7041,'9a2eb7052b920075fbcca276a54a2b68',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(7042,'9a03dd0ab637d558dd00a509fc3d81c2',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(7043,'b0dc54220f3f211634e565a77ba593e0','\"Heads up, Battle Droids closing in!\"',5,2250,'2008-07-29'),(7044,'ab16f1e2ee6efe7aca57842340edfcd1','Worth it for Wedge alone',5,729,'2013-07-25'),(7045,'c9ecc1f43ecda32288eacba05ff9ef23','Amazing Spider-Man // 4.0 // 24 Jun. 2013 // By\n    \n    Dannymatt74\n  \n on 24 Jun. 2013 // Great toy with good detail.Got it as a present for my boy who is very into Spider-Man at present.Ok so maybe I liked this one more myself as well, but it was worth the extra money.At Christmas he can have Hulk from the same collection. | great',5,2610,'2013-05-12'),(7046,'5ba098f9a57ec39ea5a20bc56dee0168',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(7047,'53d8ac1910dd7a9021e8bae5662d6e77',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(7048,'185e23485fb0594f374b6fe1a30c6c43','But my son was happy when Santa came back because he forgot to give ...',5,2709,'2015-05-06'),(7049,'51c405d41924ce3f63eb76abe0d66dad',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(7050,'85bdbd54ef98d6b0f0a98668bf901221','...

I have seen it in a shop before and my son has played with one, so I managed to get a look at one before I bought it. Hulk is a good size for an action figure and would be to scale to most other standard action figures. He has a slightly rubbery texture. His arms move an he is jointed at the waist. When shaken or dropped against something he says things like \"no one shakes the hulk! Rah!\" and \"hulk smash!\". This is branded after the TV show Hulk Agents of Smash and there are others from that series (i.e. Red Hulk) but I have never personally seen any of the other agent of smash toys. My one complaint about the toy was that when it arrived I set the box down on the table (with my son present) and hulk yelled out from the box. The batteries are kept in through shipment so when the box arrives try to keep it away from the recipient. Also if wrapping for Christmas don\'t leave under the tree for some time. Hulk lacks discretion and will be a dead give away to kids who shake presents to try to get an idea what it is. It is also very sensitive. I tested it and dropped it lightly and it still yells out. To get the batteries out you have to remove hulk from the box and it doesn\'t look easy to reconnect him once you\'ve hit him out. Even a little battery tab would fix it - also would mean you wouldn\'t have a toy arrived with a partially used battery. Slightly annoying, but great toy. At £12.00 it\'s the cheapest I\'ve seen it in shops - B&M has it for that price so if you\'re unsure or if the price rises you can always go have a look at a B&M shop. | It looks good and sounds great // 4.0 // 6 Nov. 2015 // By\n    \n    Amazon Customer\n  \n on 6 Nov. 2015 // Bought for my son as a Christmas present.

The fact that they\'re lighter means they have a shorter range and are less likely to knock things over then they\'re falling down after hitting the ceiling, but be warned that a direct hit from one of these will still knock over a full cup of coffee!They\'re supposed to glow in the dark - a neat idea but it doesn\'t seem to work too well.

It has plenty of power to keep you on your toes but not too much that it becomes uncomfortable to fly. It’s fast and very manoeuvrable with the ability to quickly turn direction.

Here is the answer to your Christmas prayers, and the kids will love it too.The Stomp Rocket is an absurdly simply concept - there\'s really nothing to it, the only wonder is no one\'s ever thought of it before.Is it educational? Sure - and how: If given the benefit of the full, concentrated force of father\'s 17 stone frame travelling downwards with gravity (accelerating at 10m/s2, so well worth experimenting by standing on chairs, ladders, launching from trampolines etc.), these little plastic rockets really will go MILES in the air and will (wind permitting) prescribe a perfect parabola, and the rocket flites are rifled, ensuring the cylinder rotates aerodynamically and thus attains greater distance and accuracy. There; you can\'t get much more educational than that - and this would be one physics lesson I\'d happily repeat, day in day out, at least until the rockets had disappeared.And disappear they will, very quickly, either by attaining escape velocity and never returning to planet earth at all (Beagle 2 scientists, take note), or by falling apart.This is my only criticism - the whole thing is VERY flimsy indeed, and the rockets in particular will crack, the flites will fall off, and if you should sit on them, they\'re useless (there\'s a lesson in that, too!). I have seen a set of three replacement rockets advertised for £6, which is an abusrd price, given that they are just a plastic tube, a glued-on flight and a rubber nose. And there you have a further educational incentive - it would not be hard, and quite a bit of fun, I dare say, to make the rockets (or even the whole thing) yourself.Outstanding entertainment.Olly Buxton | One of the best outdoor toys you can get for the money',5,434,'2015-04-07'),(7294,'38d7a3ccc1e02dd53f6badb1fa1fa1cd','Great wheelbarrow',5,656,'2013-07-05'),(7295,'2eaaa674953ea775c2b7ec53205deea9',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(7296,'fee2a1c67e9b06df75285fa8a9569cf1','One awesome gun! // 5.0 // 16 Feb. 2010 // By\n    \n    Mr. P.

Fab! // 5.0 // 20 Jun. 2014 // By\n    \n    A. Milne\n  \nTOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 20 Jun. 2014 // We already had a 1.3m kite quite similar to this but my son decided that he\'d like a bigger one for his birthday. It\'s our first kite from HQ and I\'ve been very impressed. It seems very well made, the instructions are clear and easy to understand, (not that you actually need a lot of instruction to use this!), and it all packs away very neatly into the little pouch that it\'s supplied in which makes it extremely portable.To use, you simply have to get it out of the pouch, attach the 2 lines and you\'re off. My 10 year old son quickly got the hang of flying this and has had super fun with it. It doesn\'t need all that much wind at all and - a word of caution to anyone thinking of buying this for young kids - it does pull pretty hard if there is a decent amount of wind and on one day my son was struggling to maintain his footing and needed a hand to stay solidly on the ground!The two lines mean that you have a decent amount of control over where this kite goes and it\'s pretty responsive. All in all, we\'ve thoroughly enjoyed using this kite and it\'ll get many more outings this Summer I\'m sure. | Easy to fly',5,1908,'2015-07-31'),(7313,'373e38fbd0b43c8c43e1447d735cb652',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(7314,'f255c024dc64c97f164c8f464dd784b4','wheelbarrow',2,2291,'2011-07-19'),(7315,'74f928d4c5de16a10b505f5631f0c2dd',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(7316,'64d8df788f2d5223e7b1e70c576a5972','load of rubbish',2,1080,'2015-05-05'),(7317,'c82220a583bfd8bffae93cffe86a1fe5',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(7318,'d92172a560784840416d0f0d3bec055c',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(7319,'e686383fe652881e8c4abcfd42b2edee','Five Stars',5,2960,'2015-07-21'),(7320,'5ab554307ddbb1332322ee054e2889b1','fabulous',5,2385,'2014-04-09'),(7321,'c2df73585a8a63ada58d0845a03635cd',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(7322,'8686b9a0ac5054662459f11f42e0ce00','One Star',1,1337,'2015-05-03'),(7323,'1f29ef81ad33af15276f2b8163325116',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(7324,'0c7bd1f705dfd3aea2aae547a048b3e0','ROCKET!',4,2748,'2014-07-07'),(7325,'70b1b9e8dfde73080e2bd695defa391c','Robust and Fun',4,3010,'2015-04-24'),(7326,'2931142643ebb76f6c34fc4bc6da71ba','Stomp Rocket // 5.0 // 3 Mar. 2009 // By\n    \n    Ms. K.

It\'s a lot easier to put together, maybe the easiest of the set, but it is also the one that works best as a traditional jigsaw - i.e. judging what goes where by the pattern rather than by the numbers on the back of the pieces.I\'ve read a couple of reviews of models in this series that complain about the numbers on the back of the pieces, as if that somehow makes it less of a puzzle. To my mind, the numbering actually increases the challenge as there are a number of pieces that are identically shaped and could fit in a few different places, so making sure it all fits together in the right order takes longer and is therefore a way of increasing the value for money.It also has in its favour the best stand of the landmarks series - rather than tabs that are too small to hold the model securely on a cardboard base, you build it around a sturdy plastic base, and it\'s not going to fall over at the slightest knock, as the others are prone to.The plastic pieces all fit together so well that once assembled it is absolutely smooth and works well as a traditional model for displaying. | Great puzzle // 5.0 // 11 Jan. 2013 // By\n    \n    bettybrighton\n  \n on 11 Jan. 2013 // Great game and was a lot of fun for granddaughter.

It will make you hungry, and frustrated, as so many of the cake toppings are very similar and there are ever SUCH a lot of them. \"Perplexing\" implies an above-average level of difficulty, and I won\'t be getting one of these perplexing puzzles again. Quite seriously, I\'m only 51 but I had to order a magnifying glass with LEDs to complete this puzzle, so minute were the details. This glass came from China, and took three about weeks, so the whole jigsaw puzzle experience took  two months instead of two days. By the time I had finished, I was no longer on holiday in Cornwall in a rainy caravan, but back at work in Gloucestershire, with six additional grey hairs.Finally, there are absolutely no mountains, birds, nor holiday scenes (unless you count thoughts of village bake sales) in this image.

Jewel Bright and amazing.Next is the construction.The pieces fit really well thanks to an expensive quality die cutting.Each piece fits really well and there is no confusion over whether a piece fits or not because each is individual and to a premium cut.The card is premium and thick.No looses edges nor dust about like some cheaper ones.The surface is matt so there is non of that annoying reflection that makes the puzzle more of a chore rather than a joy.Most people do puzzles with indoor lights and the reflections are cancelled out.Result. You can concentrate on selecting the pieces.Now where the jigsaw takes your breath away is that once pieced together you can, with confidence pick the whole thing up without ‘need of any puzzle conserver’ in other words no pieces will separate and fall.It has a linen effect, is varnished and that matt finish means it is brilliant for mounting for display.The final thing must be the price.For a jigsaw of this quality and build you would expect to pay three times the price and still consider it a sound buy.Totally one hundred per cent recommended.Total Quality From Start To Finish. | Great fantasy jigsaw with intriguing details // 5.0 // 29 Oct. 2015 // By\n    \n    Mrs W.\n  \n on 29 Oct. 2015 // I agree with other reviewers that the image is quite dark when completed, but it has lovely, intriguing details and I would buy another Ciro Marchetto puzzle as his artwork is fascinating. You can imagine your own fantasy world while working on it. I found the puzzle easy to do as the pieces can be separated out to work on the very distinct sections and each piece only seems to go in its own unique place. The fit between the pieces is not as tight as it is with other brands (e.g. Ravensburger) so it is not easy to move sections about. A fabulous jigsaw. | Beautiful and magical design from Ciro Marchetti, but (unusual?) defects from this Schmidt product. // 3.0 // 30 Dec. 2015 // By\n    \n    Mélanie\n  \n on 30 Dec. 2015 // I have another puzzle from the same artist. Always detailed, beautiful and magical.The reason for the average review this time: Schmidt puzzles are usually of good quality, but the one I received has misshaped pieces. Some are badly bent and one piece has a big imprint in the middle so it isn\'t flat (I imagine this is from the disassembly process after the cutting). Have they changed the production process? Or is it a one-time fault? I don\'t know.

Holmes\n  \n on 19 Jun. 2014 // I bought the first \"collector\'s set\", not realizing that what I was purchasing was the BOX IMAGES of the old Wasgij puzzles, and not the actual original wasgij puzzles.  Those older puzzles are hard to find in mint condition on ebay, and their packaging could use an update. Even the piece quality is better now than it was early on.  I wish Jumbo would rerelease those first Wasgij puzzles in new packaging, and I\'d hoped that\'s what these new \'collector sets\' were.  But no, what you get are 3 puzzles of **the old box images**.  In other words, there is no wasgij element to these.  There is no mystery about what the puzzle image is.To me, that\'s the whole point of a wasgij -- not knowing what the puzzle image is. If you like the box images enough to want to do a puzzle of them, then this set is a good deal. But if you were hoping for a re-release of the original Wasgij puzzles, as I was, don\'t be fooled. This isn\'t it.I\'m putting this review up because I noticed on the first set many other reviewers were fooled and disappointed that the puzzles were NOT the original wasgij images. I hope to spare anyone else the same mistake on this set. | A Broken Pencil Mark 2 // 2.0 // 11 Aug. 2014 // By\n    \n    Glenn Cook\n  \nHALL OF FAMETOP 50 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 11 Aug. 2014 // Oh Dear,I am totally in agreement with my fellow reviewer Mr Holmes.These 3 jigsaws seem a little bit pointless and do not deserve the name WASGIJ?Let me make myself clear on this.Wasgij make really good jigsaws.BUTThe selling point and their whole reason for being so enjoyable is that they have a twist.The name WASGIJ gives a clue it is of course Jigsaw backwards.Now with a Wasgij you have to guess what is coming in the case of The Keen Gardener who has used a tad too powerful flower feed from the point of view looking back.In the case of the Marriage Photograph why is the groom looking so shocked and who exactly is aproaching (IT would be BIG oF Me to tell you  but why bother. The picture on the box is the one you have to complete?The whole point of the jigsaws is discovering these facts, getting the jokes that come fast and furious as they are gradually revealed as you solve the jigsaws.THIS IS NOT the case for these three.Just like volume 1Wasgij Limited Edition Original Collector\'s Box Jigsaw Puzzles (1000 Pieces/ Pack of 3)what you get is the actual pictures thus defeating the whole point of a WASGIJ.Fine if you like Jigsaws pointless if you are a Wasgij fan.The box clearly states \'the box images you have waiting to puzzle\'Not for me they haven\'t!I wonder why they released this as a celebration?It is like a broken pencil.(pointless- Edmund Blackadder)Now all is not lost these are fine jigsaws to complete and they are very well made. The art work is attractive but as I said the whole extra joy that a Wasgij gives you is missing and that is one of the major attractions. | Pictures too small // 4.0 // 4 Mar. 2015 // By\n    \n    K stewart\n  \n on 4 Mar. 2015 // I obviously didn\'t read the other reviews as I too expected true Wasjigs.

Ambulances filled the street for a couple of hours as his life threatening injuries were treated. Luckily he survived and a couple of days later he was released from hospital, after my mother and I frequently visited him bringing him flowers and chocolates to wish him well soon. However, this was not the end of the drama, as 5 days later I happened to come home early in the day to find my mother and the delivery man kissing in my living room! My mother was having an affair!!

The water hose works well and can squirt quite far, but the plastic bit at the end of the hose does come off easily so can get lost as it is quite small (easy to put back on though). The ladder is not so easy to extend as you have to push quite hard on the plastic piece while pulling so is a struggle for and adult to do (there was no instructions on how to do this so had to scratch our heads for a while before we figured it out). The noises are good and not too loud and it does come with another set of light covers so those can also get lost if you make the mistake of showing your 3 year old how to change them.

The model comes with the long engine body plus its tender.  It is an interesting look and a fun colour scheme that does track the original fairly well.  The model as a whole is quite long so can fly a bit if going too fast round corners.The Flying Scotsman recalls the heyday of steam when an exciting journey from London to Scotland on the most famous train.  The name is iconic, its journeys speak to a time now past but which still stir nostalgia among those of us too young to have been part of them.  The Flying Scotsman was the first engine to reach 100mph so a great fun little fact for a parent and child to enjoy.The Bigjigs recreation unfortunately comes with the two small front wheels raised.  This design decision as with some others in the heritage collection is a mistake and makes the toy look uglier than it should.  The body itself is nice.Durability has been good so far with this model having survived over a year with no damage at all.As part of the Heritage Collcetion, the Flying Scotsman is of course a must-have.  It is not perfect but it is a great addition to a small person\'s wooden railway collection. | Good Quality // 5.0 // 7 Dec. 2015 // By\n    \n    Angie\n  \n on 7 Dec. 2015 // Well Packaged. and seems good quality.

But it seems that Take and Play is more portable in so far as it folds up easier and contains less parts, perhaps it will replace the Take Along range.Anyway, this play set is a fun track - the magnetic items can be hoisted up and lowered using the little crank. The oval track isn\'t very big but it has a bridge to add some interest, but of course the set can be connected up to any other track in the Take Along/Take and Play range. Cranky is telescopic and simply pushes down into itself to allow the track to fold around it and form an easy to carry bundle. The Salty Engine included can be stored under the bridge and is held in place by the track when folded. This comes with a little cargo-boat too which is a nice addition and allows for even more imaginative play.The oval track isn\'t made of individual pieces, it is one hinged piece - that makes this incredibly easy to set up and put away. This is perfect to grab and take out if you want to keep your little occupied for a while, you can be fairly certain that you won\'t lose essential bits!In a nutshell: This is a small Thomas track but it still provides a fair amount of play value. A great toy to take out of the house when young ones may get a bit bored - and a great toy to use at home in conjunction with any other tracks they may have. | A great improvement on the older model. // 5.0 // 10 Mar. 2011 // By\n    \n    E.

The crane extends to a decent height, the hook winds up and down, the boom lifts and the hook even has a decent strength magnet in it so that it can pick up the supplied barrels. The signal/barrier is a nice feature that acts to hold the kit together when in \"take\" mode and gives something else to interact with when in \"play\" mode.My only gripe is the fact  poor old Cranky can collapse without too much pressure, and there\'s been many an occasion where our little one has been leaning on the crane only to have it \"telescope\" back down to it\'s shortest setting. Over time I expect this will become more frequent as the p[lastic wears and friction doesn\'t do as good a job of holdding it up. It would have been nice if there was a simple locking mechanism that kept things standing tall.All things considerd, it\'s highly recommended. | A big hit',5,603,'2011-07-27'),(7794,'0a3cd40ea53168d89620e88d80374946',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(7795,'24e9876d4a53092a4ee49d2412aa543a','Mum of a Thomas fanatic // 4.0 // 17 Nov. 2003 // By\n    \n    A Customer\n  \n on 17 Nov. 2003 // Quite expensive but dont be put off by the price as it is well worth the money.

The crane head rotates in a complete circle (and then back again, not around and around), and the magnet on the rope goes up and down with another crank. Ours has been in use for several years now, and I\'m pleased and surprised to report that the string has not broken despite heavy use.There is one problem with this toy (other than the hefty price). The crane head comes off very easily, and putting it back on is too fiddley for a young child. It\'s got a round peg which slots into a round hole, but with one slightly flattened edge so it must be lined up just so to work. The adults on hand are called over several times during each play session to reafix the head so play can resume.Our Cranky has seen a lot of use for magnetics experiments, totally apart from his day job in wooden Sodor.  Worth the cost for the years of play, as long as everyone is prepared to deal with the frequent assembly crises. | Good but one big flaw // 3.0 // 22 Jun. 2011 // By\n    \n    Ms. M.

The Take n Play vehicles are the only Thomas products that I\'ve seen that are really good quality.We have Thomas wooden railway and Mega Bloks Thomas railways, and the Take n Play are definitely my favourite.  The sets are well made too, and survive a great deal of misuse from our toddler without damage - and because every thing is so small and the sets fold up they\'re very easy to carry around.Another nice touch is that the magnetic couplers work either way, there\'s none of this constant swapping ends to get things to couple up that you get with the wooden railway series.If we were starting again, we probably wouldn\'t bother with the wooden railway, and definitely would give the Mega Bloks sets a miss.  The Take n Play sets are all you really need for Thomas obsessed kids, especially if you\'re short of space and/or need to transport them back and forwards.  You can connect two or more sets together with the extra track pack and end up with quite an interesting little layout which is easy to set up and dismantle and takes very little space when packed away. | A Nice Troublesome Truck',5,1550,'2011-04-02'),(7835,'c5e27057fd075fa39c5ae7cc98753ba3',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(7836,'cedbcf04d0878fbd88e1fe083a4ec4ef','Adds interest .',4,333,'2014-04-25'),(7837,'9d426c646fc679932b4aa0822f9a3b7b','nice toy arrived broken // 3.0 // 18 Jun. 2012 // By\n    \n    Wolfies wife\n  \n on 18 Jun. 2012 // Nice toy ordered and delivered quickly, unfortunately i wrapped it and gave it to my son before opening and checking the toy only for him to open it and to be very upset as the tracks were both broken but concealed under the toy until he\'d ripped the box open. very disappointed | Present for a friend\'s son // 5.0 // 1 Feb. 2012 // By\n    \n    Karen S.

One separate piece of track to take trains up to the  top of the mine, then the other section of track has the mine built round it. At the bottom is a small swing door (very easy to insert). Swings nice and easily when trains roll through it.The mine artwork is painted onto to the side. Reasonable quality, perhaps looks a bit on the cheap side, but nice for the kids.Very popular with my son - dropping the train from the top, it disappears momentarily, and crashes nicely through the gate. Has spent ages just doing this since he got it.In summary, an excellent toy - however, not awarding a full 5 stars, as value for money rating is quite a bit lower, when you see the wooden parts involved compared to similar items, it comes across as pretty poor value for money. | Mostly Well Built // 4.0 // 21 Jan. 2016 // By\n    \n    MLA\n  \nVINE VOICE on 21 Jan. 2016 // The Thomas & Friends Wooden Railway Quarry is a fun two-piece set featuring a rising piece of track and a mine tunnel heading back down again.  It is remarkably sturdy though the weak-spot is the door at the back of the mine.  The rising track fits well and never inadvertently comes lose.  The tunnel is a lot of fun but the door lasted just over a year before falling off.The look of the piece is good.  It fits well onto any wooden rwailway system.  The slate grey makes sense as quarry/mine.  The angle of ascent and decent works well so trains can be pushed up and left to freely flow down again the other side.  The door at the back of the quarry adds to the enjoyment as it opens and shuts from the impact of the train.  Unfortunately the door is the piece not built to last.There is a slightly different design effect on the ascending piece of wooden rail.  It marks the quarry out as different and also makes it slightly easier to spot in a box of wooden railway equipment.Compared to rival producers, the Thomas & Friends wooden railway pieces are more expensive.  This item is not cheap but is a worthwhile addition to a wooden railway collection. | Fab // 5.0 // 27 Mar. 2014 // By\n    \n    R Jones\n  \n on 27 Mar. 2014 // Well made and makes a fun addition to a growing train set, although it could have been made a bit sturdier, my three year old does tend to press quite hard which causes it to wobble and come uncoupled at the top.

Only down side I have seen is that instead of putting the battery in the main train body it is in the tender. Which is connected by a single wire to the main motor/wheels.

It\'s a brilliant figurine for play, display, or photography, and is made to a very high quality!The body of this figma is astounding, the skirt of Link\'s tunic is made of a softer flexible plastic, meaning you can pose his legs without it getting in the way. The legs and feet themselves are rather sturdy, and he\'s very capable of standing even without his stand. The arms are also of equal good quality. His joints are easy to move freely, and won\'t pop out unless you force them, and despite my expectations, his adaptable hat actually looks very effective in photographs.The interchangeable pieces all work brilliantly. The expressions are exactly like the actual Link in-game, and his sword and shield will fit into either hand and onto his back, and there\'s even a second place to attach his stand whilst he\'s wearing sword and shield. The effect for his sword works brilliantly and looks amazing in photographs.The only real issue I have with this figure is that his sword is not easy to fit into his hand. I read about many people on-line who tried to pop open the sword or to force it into Link\'s hand, and ended up breaking the sword (which is very thin and could easily break). The way I solved this issue was I ran Link\'s sword-holding hand under hot water until the plastic softened, opened up the grip a little more, than ran it under cold water to set it. This makes slipping the sword in and out of hand much easier.Overall, a brilliant quality action figure, and definitely worth the money you pay for it, just be careful with his sword! | Link comes alive!',5,2339,'2013-05-15'),(8163,'f8642aab7ffcd12185af644936ae589a',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(8164,'da63e0cf363eeee3c68ae39662325674',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(8165,'552d703a1523d2e44f8cd0608ef93b10',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(8166,'ab5c8512001955b16b0e273030ff4130',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(8167,'1c63a75d20698cbb8730339d9702f604',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(8168,'4ed3327f61d131889c3fd2f4fef38fc6',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(8169,'4433cfaa93d5cac5da8f36391585cbf1',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(8170,'7df269eeaa2bb7bc197112e76f3f5b62',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(8171,'6bce116f688f1a031db0632e61c76f0c','Great cake topper :)',5,3124,'2015-04-16'),(8172,'ff77ec0b4e6a70783a9d9f57d37e845e','Its a nice model, probably could be better priced when you ...',4,306,'2014-07-01'),(8173,'4f48f15e1e114776dd1391d1c78dec83','Five Stars',5,1241,'2015-05-25'),(8174,'0a89b9012624ef14930374b7b398d259',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(8175,'0b3274b6ecb5edf16d66b83a616a3d6b',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(8176,'eb79c984f6c9eecb6647f39ddf46df2b',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(8177,'6c3d172de839f063b21210f8e83946eb','Mockingjay Part 1 Pin // 5.0 // 20 Dec. 2014 // By\n    \n    Glen\n  \n on 20 Dec. 2014 // Really good quality well finished  Recommended to all \"Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 1\" Film Fans.

The material is soft and does not tear or deform.

They are very well made from a very thick and high quality plush fabric and unlike the glove puppets in the range, these are partly stuffed so will sit, stand or pose like a soft, cuddly toy.This rat puppet is surprisingly life-like and, if you\'re not a great lover of rats, it could also be a little creepy. The tail is quite realistic from a distance - so be warned!!Having said that, it is fun to bring to life. It can wash itself, groom and, if you have good finger dexterity in operating its very tiny mouth, it can \'speak\'.These puppets are predominantly targeted at children but they can also be used by adults with small hands. My hand is 19cm long and it\'s a very tight squeeze to say the least but I can just about operate its paws and mouth simultaneously.The mouth is very small so if you\'re specifically looking for a puppet to \'speak\' then it would be better to seek one with a larger mouth but if you just need it to \'act\' like a live rat, then it will not disappoint an adult or child looking to have a bit of light-hearted fun! | Wonderful addition to the props box',5,1780,'2010-04-08'),(8397,'bc68810f6c884de06593590b05f1385e',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(8398,'1a6f15656c09c0e3ff45d9171ca67282',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(8399,'7ea9d694d27c8f2b876bbdab7e2b1596','Chopper the shark // 4.0 // 31 Oct. 2010 // By\n    \n    emsy\n  \n on 31 Oct. 2010 // Chopper is a lovely shark, my little girl really likes him a lot.

The main body is a very thick, long-\'fur\' fabric (which can shed a little in its first few uses) and the feet and beak are made from brushed nylon.This large-size (approx 40cm long excluding tail) puppet can be used by young children, teenagers or even adults.  I have large hands and long arms but still find them comfortable to use.  The large beak is very easy to operate and, unlike some other puppets which force the operator to move both the upper and lower beak/jaw, it is easy and comfortable to move only the lower beak.  This is a much more natural and realistic movement than raising the upper beak for the bird to \'speak\' or squawk.  The squawker inside the mouth is surprisingly loud and makes a fairly realistic bird-squawk sound rather than a typical squeaker-squeak.  It can also be removed, if preferred.I use these puppets to make entertainment videos for a mostly adult audience, including a special needs group of adults.  I\'ve found that adults with a sense of humour seem to appreciate them just as much as children of all ages from toddlers to pre-teens.  They\'re very versatile, great fun and I think they offer exceptional value for money considering their quality.  I have nearly the full range of these birds and I generally operate them in pairs with them interacting together for performances.A very good buy and great fun too, limited only by your own or your child\'s creativity and imagination. | Great Fun',5,121,'2014-05-23'),(8406,'f0986aba820c2b52bf2ba69ced719d0e',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(8407,'4da340d6742fc740956bdf5833cfe834','Mi son loves it',5,2133,'2013-04-11'),(8408,'c34da4b32d23abd1c869cfad56a9d399',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(8409,'c7a0ae2cae1a279c826c88291f55f051',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(8410,'84c48200b4bc0245cb7de9468a865a91','Great buy // 5.0 // 22 Jun. 2011 // By\n    \n    SGR\n  \n on 22 Jun. 2011 // My 7 yr old absolutely loves this toy, images of Rod Hull and Emu come to my mind when I see him play with it!

Although probably intended as a child\'s toy, the puppet is also suitable for use by an adult, eg to amuse and entertain a child or in a performance.  One of the most appealing features is the opening mouth which is workable and opens to create various facial expressions and help with expressing emotion.  On opening wide, the monster can be made to smile broadly which can be quite a surprise if the mouth has been kept shut for the earlier part of his performance.  The mouth is also fitted with a loud \'squeaker\' which I personally would find quite annoying so it was instantlly removed with a quick snip.A recommended and value-for-money purchase for anyone, either child or adult, who enjoys playing with puppets. | the munsterrrrr',4,2088,'2010-07-13'),(8412,'33995b559c000e800fd7901c7d7986af',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(8413,'e45d95d8ef43ea59b5d18e869e5e1f95',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(8414,'b2277ce9d6ea58722f6c6aa3735d3c10','one of the best // 5.0 // 27 Jan. 2014 // By\n    \n    Trevor Hodson\n  \n on 27 Jan. 2014 // This item was bought to complete the set of Sooty Sweet and Soo for our Granddaughters very good quality recommend the buy.

They can easily be animated and brought to life by any child or adult with a playful side and some imagination.  Their mouths are easy to work, especially for an adult who will also have the finger strength and dexterity to squeeze the small squeaker in the puppet\'s tongue.These puppets are not just for children - I\'m a mature (well, perhaps that is questionable...) adult with long arms and large hands and I find the puppets a perfect size for my arm and hand and very easy to operate.They\'ll provide ongoing fun and amusement limited only by the user\'s imagination. I like to use a pair or trio of puppets to interact and perform together and the bright colours and jaunty facial expressions of the characters within the range complement each other well (see my uploaded photos).A great buy and fantastic value for money too! | Sockettes rock my world! // 4.0 // 1 Aug. 2012 // By\n    \n    Victoria\n  \n on 1 Aug. 2012 // This puppet is awesome!I bought it to use with children and they love it!

It\'s definitely a toy (and is sold as such), but there is just enough detail, function and realism to satisfy the adult collector.  Some modifications can be made to enhance the model, for example - painting the shiny rivets yellow, and swapping the bucket for a proper two-part clam bucket.I\'ve docked a star as the bonnet is made of plastic, there\'s an unnatural gap behind the front wheels, the rivets are shiny silver and disassembly is difficult as the model is riveted together (these all need to be drilled out to be able to take it to pieces to modify and improve).Really though, it is a toy, and a very good one at that! | Older JCB type toy/model // 5.0 // 19 Mar. 2015 // By\n    \n    Foo\n  \n on 31 Jan. 2014 // This is a lovely little toy/model.

It does not spin, and any attempt at spinning it would result in it falling to pieces on the floor, the tiny hourglass had a little shape flaw. Overall it feels delicate but it\'s very pretty at first sight and with a little care could be carried around but it does not satisfy the feel and the imagination, it rather looks like a \"muggle reproduction\" if i may say so.P.S. such a product shouldn\'t have been more than 5 pounds, 8 with the display case. | Looked good but didn\'t actually work // 5.0 // 5 Jun. 2015 // By\n    \n    Muggle\n  \n on 5 Jun. 2015 // Looked good but didn\'t actually work.

It has inner frame (unlike the HG models I own) which allows to make more poses, that is cool. It is my first time with RG so I experienced a lot of parts popped out when trying to assemble all them together. It was not as smooth as my experience with HG models and it take more time. Maybe because I\'m a first timer. But they give a lot of spare parts and stickers which I like (in case I lose it). And I notice the model is more detailed in terms of its features and more colors.

The decals are also stickers, no water needed which i found was really handy, I remember using decals when i was young and they could be a real pain to apply.One thing though, careful when you\'re cutting the inner skeleton parts off the sprue. Some are connected via actual connecting points used to attach the pieces together and I accidentally cut off a bit. Fixed it with some glue though.Would highly recommend even to a non Gundam fan. | Real Grade Freedom Gundam // 5.0 // 20 Mar. 2014 // By\n    \n    Duncan\n  \n on 20 Mar. 2014 // Great to build with lots of detail and gimmicks crammed into its small size.

Although the model has some weight distribution issues with the wings it can be stood up by positioning the feet slightly further apart.

It transforms really easily and looks great in either mode, our 2 year old can do it too. Whilst not wanting my son to learn of such things just yet, the best way to describe the transforming action is to say it\'s like a flick knife.The arms are moveable and poseable. One gripe is the arms do get pulled off but it\'s all robust enough that they clip back on easily enough. And me being fussy I wish the chest plate sat better in robot mode as the spring lifts it up a bit, but my 4 year old doesn\'t care.Loving have Transformers to play with again although these just don\'t seem as well built as the ones I use to play with 30 years ago.

You don;t have to take the head off to get the poncho on or off, the head does move slightly ,, my hubby held his legs and I pulled the poncho over the head ... The crossbows proved little difficult to get in place at first, until I realised his arms move up and down so the best thing is to move the arms up first to give you room to work with  .. theres a thin part on the handle squeeze the between his fingers and thumb then you can rotate the crossbow so that the handle is in his hand (no need for warming with hairdryers) .. One problem I was having was he wasn\'t standing well..but his feet also move slightly and once I moved his feet a bit he was standing with no movement and not unsteady in the slightest ..

Designed for nostalgic grown-ups with disposable income and not for children, it\'s a series of very good to excellent toys (admittedly with the occasional quality control issue), trying to incorporate everything that has ever been associated with He-Man.  They\'ve tried to include items from the original vintage Masters of the Universe toys, to the 1980s Filmation He-Man and She-Ra cartoons, to the 1990s sci-fi-themed revival, to the \"Millennial\" toys and cartoons of 2002-2004, to unproduced concept figures that were planned but never made.  It\'s the most comprehensive and wide-reaching reincarnation of the property to date.  And now Mattel has gone and made the long-desired centrepiece of the line: Castle Grayskull.Based on the original prototype and beautifully sculpted by The Four Horsemen workshop, this version of the castle has features not seen on the Vintage or Millennial versions of this playset.Read more › | OK',5,410,'2015-04-06'),(9089,'90d1c690c16239918bb1cd5a9352a19f',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(9090,'f8c81d383bfdad71c8353f8019b0436b','Azmuth // 4.0 // 29 Aug. 2011 // By\n    \n    Cam Clark (SKULL1138)\n  \n on 29 Aug. 2011 // This toy suffers form the opposite effect of most Ben 10 Villains, he is far too large in scale in fact is pretty much the same size as the modern Vilgax when stood side by side, not too good when you consider that in the Cartoon Vilgax can hold Azmuth in 1 hand.Also comes with I presume the Ultimatrix, but this is huge and probably scaled right for Azmuth, but far too large for rest of the figure range.

(I checked the film and this is correct-he is the tallest!)His movable eyes are perfect and Gizmos pupils should have been around the same size.GEORGE has the same sculpt as the others apart from the head which is spot on, he looks grumpy and has squinted eyes, but his eyes are so hard to see that the moving eyes feautre is almost pointless on this figure.Overall I really like this wave of figures.I would give them 4 out of 5 as the paint on the fur can be a bit sloppy in places, Gizmos eyes are a bit off model and even in today\'s market, these figures are overpriced for the size.£10 each would be a great price point for them.Cant wait for wave 2 of the Mogwai to finish the set which includes Combat Gizmo, Daffy and Mowhawk. | Five Stars // 5.0 // 5 Jan. 2015 // By\n    \n    Casey\n  \n on 5 Jan. 2015 // Excellent! | Five Stars',5,1212,'2015-04-04'),(9145,'7e36c23b38b2e397ff0e5f247ae7c707',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(9146,'5d10fec13e9974603b1c411c940807a8',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(9147,'a4d12de5e84c0a25bf674d7297e8dc29','Yet another great statue // 5.0 // 12 Feb. 2015 // By\n    \n    Mark Robinson\n  \n on 12 Feb. 2015 // Another fantastic statue from Kotobukiya.

This figure, in my opinion, has the best actor likeness of any figure ever in this scale and price range.From every angle, this is undeniably Robert Englund, the paint also adds alot to the head sculpt. Its not too often you can say the figure in hand equals the quality of the production photos.Other than that, its the same Freddy from the neck down, and his only accessory is his fedora.

Children learn to take turns in the game and count the number of pairs at the end of the game to determine the winner. They learn to be a bit competitive too!

I found this is perfect as there are no stickers so there\'s no icky bits peeling off giving the whole cube a much more stylish feel. It\'s great for showing off and doing finger tricks however the speed at which it spins does mean that I lose control of how many turns it does at once. Also, a few times it has happened that the center pieces have popped out because of the speed of the finger tricks, but it\'s not too big an issue as they popped back in just as easily as they came out. The only thing that made me consider not buying this specific cube was that I was told that not having stickers meant that the sides get scratched easily. I would like to address this issue. It is not true. My cube has been through everything: school bags, gravely floors, it fell out of my hands a few times and there are no scratches on it.

The puzzle pieces are durable and I like that there are photos of the animals and not just cartoon-like pictures like in other puzzles. However, the photos are a bit dark, and some of the pictures are just a bit too small (like some of the \"babies\" pics), so one has to look really carefully to tell between the small animals. I don\'t know if it is just our puzzle that is too dark, because none of other reviewers wrote about it. The box is also durable, but it is difficult to open for a small child, which means I have to open it for my daughter and then close again.

My sons face seriously brightened up when I pulled out this toy/game.In the box you will find 2 parts of the bridge that easily clip together, 1 bag of red dominoes and 1 pack of multicoloured dominoes; you will also find some track parts and some stickers. While you set up the track (if your child\'s too young) allows them to stick the funny faces onto the dominoes. What\'s great is that the red dominoes clip onto the tracks so you don\'t need to faff about standing them up individually. The coloured dominoes are basically extras so you can extend and customise your full track.To get your rally going you ping back a domino and it shoots around the loop-de-loop and then it all falls down *yay* You can also knock a separate white domino and have two rallies going at once in a sort of race-rally.My son is still thinking up novel ways to make his rallies fall and doesn\'t seem to be growing bored of it which is rare. Normally he grows bored of toys within the week.I\'d give this four out of five stars because it\'s awesome; it can get stressful standing up the coloured dominoes of course so I\'d advise leaving to the child.

Now, this was a collection of adults and they were expecting an afternoon of lazing in the sunshine while polishing off a couple of boxes of wine. However, the opportunity to watch my father, notoriously pompous and an extraordinarily bad loser, tackling an egg and spoon race like there was an Olympic gold waiting for him at the end of it was just too delicious for me to resist.This set comes with everything you see in the picture plus appropriate instructions in three languages. These do seem to suggest that this is a child\'s game but I see no reason why grown-ups can\'t get a piece of that action. The assembled crowd that afternoon certainly saw it that way - after some initial grumbling and groaning anyway. The various bits and pieces are very helpfully provided in four colours which, with eight adults, was clearly going to mean two in each team. That\'s where things started going just a tiny bit wrong. Nobody wanted my father on their team, given that he was bound to take the whole thing too seriously. And nobody wanted me on their team either, given that I \'throw, run and catch like a girl\'. Now, I can\'t deny that accusation (it\'s these moobs I think), but I must question why any of that might be a negative thing. Rather tragically, that put us both on the same team. The only good thing about it was that I made sure we were the Pink Team. You should have seen his face.We set up the start and finish lines and got cracking with the first event - the bean bag race. I was the winner of that one although not, as one of my opponents so harshly suggested, because of my fat head. Actually, it wasn\'t my opponent at all... for some reason it was my own team-mate.

There were 19 of us ranging in ages from 6 weeks to 55yrs and I wanted to bring out the child in all of us so thought this would be fun.  We\'d hired a photographer to take pics of us as a group as it was a bit of a family reunion and we set this up while she was there and she stayed to take pics of us all being big kids and having fun.  The equipment is basic but good quality. The sacks were big enough and strong enough for all the adults (and we have some large ones in our family!) and the kids thought they were great.  The Egg and spoon race was great, the eggs are a little on the light side so fell off quite easily but still good fun.  We did various races with the bean bags, adults had them on their heads and kids crawled with them on their backs.  The only thing that was a bit of a let down were the 3-legged race bands, they were really too big and came undone very easily.As school sports days are so non-competitive these days it was great to go with tradition and battle it out.  We added in some of our own races, buggy races for the babies etc and everyone said it was the best day of the holiday!

I am also a Mum with young children of my own! I was looking for a reading game to play with my 5 year old at home and I came across Kloo. It is working wonders in boosting my son\'s enthusiasm for reading and is a lot of fun. I was so impressed with the card game that I decided to write a review from a professional point of view - here it is:)There are 3 fun, early reading games that can be played with a deck of colourful Kloo cards. The cards are high quality, bright and clear - designed to build young children\'s confidence in reading words and sequencing basic sentences.  Kloo is most appropriate for a teacher or parent to play with children aged 4-7 years.The reading cards are colour-coded, with one word printed on each; some words are phonetically easy to read, some are a little harder. Arrows on each card cleverly direct children to build a sentence, word by word. There are also \"Zoo\" cards, with an animal on each - these are an excellent incentive to concentrate, since children can win an animal card as a reward for reading words correctly. An extension activity is to win objects for the animals - such as a ball, food or a blanket.Kloo encourages young children to practise and take pride in their reading - the colour-corded cards automatically direct the player to the next correct word, taking away any undue stress and allowing the child to focus and find enjoyment in reading.The Kloo Zoo game can easily be simplified for children with very basic reading skills - for example, Nursery-aged children. The game can just as easily be extended to consolidate skills of more confident readers in Reception or Year 1.With three fun reading games within one compact deck, Kloo Reader Cards are ideal for playing in the classroom, at home or for taking on holiday. | Fun to do and really versatile // 5.0 // 6 Sept. 2012 // By\n    \n    JuliaH\n  \n on 6 Sept. 2012 // My class really enjoyed playing this game.  I\'ve played it with my grand children who really enjoyed winning animals for their zoo and making up sentences.  Even the little one was able to join in with some help from me.Then, being a Literacy Teacher I thought that I could use the cards with some of my own learners (ones I know well and I was confident would like the idea of a game) as a filler to rehearse sentence building skills.  I was able to adapt the game after the first run through so that they thought about grammar and parts of speech and they began building their own sentences with new words that they suggested.  The Kloo Cards proved an excellent jumping off point for all sorts of English Language activities.  They\'re a regular part of my teaching kit now and the grand children always ask to play when they visit. | Word recognition by stealth // 5.0 // 23 Sept. 2012 // By\n    \n    Ben Marks\n  \n on 23 Sept. 2012 // A superb game.  So far we\'ve mainly used Kloo as a version of the pelmanism card game - lay all the cards face down and pick up two cards, hoping to find a pair.  It stresses the memory (my memory at least) and acts as a fast and fun version of reading flash cards!  I guess the ideal age is for 4, 5 or 6 year old kids although it may be helpful if your child is maybe a bit older but struggles with word recognition (which is our situation).

Each player (up to 4) gets a different shopping list consisting of 5 items, and by throwing the dice and moving around the board you can pick up the matching items if you land on the relevant squares.  The first to complete the shopping list is the winner.My kids quite like playing with this, they enjoy rolling the die and counting the squares to move.  They also like it when they can pick up the items on their list.What they don\'t like (and this happens a lot) is moving around the board again and again because they fail to get to the necessary square to pick up the one or two items remaining on their list.  Quite often all the players are stuck in a merry-go-round, going round and round the board because no one can hit the needed square to pick up the last item on the list.  There are two of each type of square (two grocery squares, two dairy squares, etc.) but this doesn\'t help as the item is only located at one of them, so if you\'re after milk and you land on the other dairy square then tough.If you\'re lucky you can finish the game quite quickly and everyone is happy, but if you\'re not able to land on the correct squares then the game develops into such tedium that your kids will get bored or angry.

The rules included in this set are open to interpretation, but this is not important as long you agree what they are to be.This particular set of double-twelve dominoes is well made with clear coloured dots, although some of the colours are similar (inevitable with twelve colours).  The dominoes have a nice feel to them and enough weight to be stable when standing up (you don\'t want your dominoes falling over for all to see).  There was no smearing of the dot colouring and no marks on the underside (as reported in another review).Be prepared for the tin box (incidentally it is decorated differently to that shown on the web page) to be damaged, as the packaging it was sent in was woefully inadequate.  I spent half an hour in the shed gently teasing the \"bruised\" corners back into a good enough shape for the lid to fit acceptably well.  This was a pity as the box is attractive.All in all, worth the £9 paid and would recommend it to all.PS have just spent a week in France staying with French friends and had to leave the game behind!

In fact many of the names from the cards have entered his family vocabulary. \"Mr Cunningleigh Sligh\" the aristocratic fox with a shot gun, \"Hoppy Spadge\" the well dressed sparrow, \"Barnaby Littlemouse\", \"Millicent Littlemouse\", \"Humphrey Goggle\" the frog, with his wife \"Mrs Croak\",  \"Widow Pintips\" the hedgehog, \"Prettiwigs Pattikin\" the squirrel, \"Dr. Bunfuz\" the rabbit, \"Tippetty Nippet\" the baby squirrel in bed, \"Nubby Tope\" the resourceful mole. All these names cause gales of laughter amongst the parents of our grandchildren who we are now busy indoctrinating with this hilarious game. Racey Helps (another funny name really) is a children\'s artist who is held in great affection. The pack contains instructions for playing Snap! and Grab Snap! in case you have forgotten the rules ( which have to be loose with littlies) together with the 44 cards which make up 11 sets of 4 cards each so there\'s plenty of chance of a SNAP!

The earliest purchase on animals of the world had the question-box and an inflatable globe; the questions were well adapted by my daughter (a qualified secondary teacher) but the boys found the globe an excellent soft sphere to bounce off each other for hours of unintended fun. It turned out to be stronger than it looked, although, having bought a softball for them, it is now safely on the bookshelf!Although this is too complicated for my two just yet, like the earlier investments (in their education), it will be adapted, e.g. extending reading times, until they are old enough and I have little doubt they will enjoy it at all its various levels of adaptation until they are able to enjoy it just as it was intended.

There\'s nothing wrong with the basic mechanics of the game - this is basically Trivial Pursuit - Geography Edition. There are a couple of gimmicks, for example there are three different type of cards you can play when you\'re either struggling to get onto the wedge square you need, or struggling to answer a wedge card. This won\'t be welcomed the Trivial Pursuit purists, but I do know people who will be grateful for this tweak. You don\'t have to play with the bonus cards, anyway.Right, that\'s the positives over with.The problem with having equal numbers of questions about each of the continents is this. There are lots of good, sensible questions you can ask about Europe and North America which it\'s a reasonable bet that a large number of people will either know or be able to guess. Less so about Latin America and Africa  - even less so about Asia. Then we come to Oceania. The setter\'s own lack of knowledge results in a bewildering range of dead giveaways, and questions that nobody could realistically be expected to know - the names of the individual Marshall Islands for example.It isn\'t just the impossible questions, though. There\'s a whole slew of currency questions, and most of them are of the \'how many puls do you get in one afghani? - variety. In every one that I\'ve found so far the answer is always 100! That\'s just careless.Which brings me to my biggest beef with this game.

No big deal if you are playing for fun, but not so good if you expect educational value.A sample of errors include a Lancaster bomber in the Battle of Britain, and 58,000 soldiers killed on the first day of the Battle of Somme. The illustration of British soldiers uniform in green is also a novelty. In the 100 years war, an english king in full armour with heraldic dress is labelled as a french soldier. The omission of Agincourt from the card may not be an error, but does seem curious.

You have 10 seconds in which to memorise as much information as possible about a country - flags, towns, exports etc.  Then you roll a dice and have to answer a numbered question about the country.  That\'s all there is to it.  If you answer correctly, you keep the card for that country.  The person with the most number of cards at the end of the game wins.  If I sat down and quizzed my children on their knowledge of flags, towns, countries, they\'d find it really dull.  For some reason the egg-timer and dice turn this into a fun game for them.

Our son is very much into factual learning at the moment and the wide variety of questions from colours on a flag to border countries and animals makes it a really great game for all.  The cards seem very durable being made of thick card and the language used is good for helping with reading/vocabulary.  Even Grandma with her great general knowledge has fun yet there are still enough challenges to keep it interesting.  The 10 minute rule has to be stretched as we so enjoy it that we keep going for another 10.

The game itself is simple enough. Set the timer, give an answer and then pass to the next person before the \'burp\' goes off. I had misgivings about the burp sound but trust me it\'s hardly noticeable, especially if there\'s music in the background. As the pud is passed it plays a sleighbell sound so you soon know when the time has run out.The questions fall into four categories -THINGS - The player must give an example of the \'thing\' on the card. The next player has to give an answer with the next letter of the alphabet.WORDS - Players must give the name of a song or book that contains the word on the card.CONNECTIONS - Players must give the name of an actor, character or association with the film on the card.CLUES - A list of items are printed on the card and players must describe them to their team without actually saying the word.The game is for 4 or more players divided into teams but we had five of us playing singly easily enough. The only questions we couldn\'t use were CLUES.The gameplay is fantastic and it was great fun watching people panic if the random pud was still in their possession and couldn\'t think of an answer!

Good game that is not too time consuming. The cases are really interesting and there are some surprising outcomes. Good game for traveling could be played in the car if you don\'t use the die to determine how many points you get for guessing a correct verdict. In our family everyone is over the age of 20.

On the one hand, you can rattle through it in practically no time at all using, for the most part, just a little common sense. And, since there are only ever two possible verdicts in each case, you\'ve got a fifty per cent chance of getting it right, even if you\'re employing the services of a coin to help you come up with your answer each time.But, lurking beneath the surface, you\'ll find a very interesting collection of legal conundrums, the real-life solutions of which can really make you think. Each case and verdict have to fit on opposite sides of an 8.5cm x 5.5cm piece of card, so details are a little thin on the ground, but each verdict is explained pretty well. The cases seem to come from all over the place (especially the USA) although, sometimes, it\'s not even made clear in which country a case was heard. It makes little difference I suppose within the context of a board game but, nevertheless, it is a minor irritation.As for the competitive element to the thing though, I\'m afraid I find the Rules of Play that they\'ve come up with to be a complete waste of time. The game and its players deserve better: MUCH better.It is designed for two players / teams, aged 12 and over. Where they got that minimum age from, I have no idea, but the inference would seem to be that people younger than that would be bored out of their minds. I\'m not too sure about that although, having tried the game out so far only on a collection of half-drunk (and, somewhat argumentative) adults, I\'ve got nothing to actually back up that statement.You\'re split into two Teams (A and B) and you share a weird-looking scorecard and a die which only goes up to three.Read more › | You be the Judge // 5.0 // 13 Feb. 2013 // By\n    \n    E Brown\n  \n on 13 Feb. 2013 // Enjoyed playing the game with family and friends.

The box opens at the end rather than having a lift off lid which means that you have to remove the plastic tray to hold the cards rather than keeping it sitting inside the box and thus keeping it nice and sturdy. Also when you stack the cards into the relevant slots for the game the answer to the first question on the card is visible to whoever is handing out the cards.Its a shame that the sudden death cards don\'t/can\'t match up with the \'round\' cards but there isn\'t really any way round that but a rejig of the box would result in a much more player friendly version | EGGHEADS FANS // 4.0 // 10 Jan. 2012 // By\n    \n    NCP7\n  \n on 10 Jan. 2012 // THE ACTUAL QUESTIONS AND SUBJECTS ARE VERY LIKE (AND JUST AS HARD !!)

It might be small but it\'s powers are amazing! Like other reviewers I was initally very sceptical about it, but after challenging it numerous times I am convinced that this toy really does live up to its \"mind-reading\" claims! I have tried thinking of very simple things, such as a lion to more obscure items and 99% of the time this amazing little toy (or should it be referred to as a gadget?!) has got it right - which frankly, began to freak me out a little bit! Just how does it know exactly what you are thinking of?! You have to be careful not to answer \"sometimes\" too often as this can affect the answer - after all, you have got to give the little gizmo a fair chance! Some of the questions however are a little obscure and you have to \'guesstimate\' the answer. Questions such as \"does the object weigh more than a duck?\" - I have never personally weighed a duck and I suppose it depends if its a particularly fat/skinny duck! :o)This toy would be great as a gift for a kid, the awkward man in your life or anyone who is a bit of a gadget lover. I am sure that these toys will be making numerous appearances in playgrounds and pubs alike, with everyone thinking of wierder objects in an attempt to try and outdo and beat this game. With the festive season fast approaching, I would highly recommend this as a fab stocking filler gift! But be warned - you can play it through the \'open\' packaging so it\'s probably best to wrap it up straight away, otherwise this fantastic toy/gadget (I\'m still not really sure what to call it!) may not make it to it\'s intended recipient!

The game consists of a bag, a timer and oval shaped cards on which there are the names of three people - fiction and non-fiction. The basic aim of the game is to describe as many people on the cards which are picked out of the bag to your team without naming the actual person in a set time limit. The game is reliant on verbal dexterity and quick thinking and anyone can play it.Sounds very basic but it fantastic fun and creates a great atmosphere in any party. It also sounds easy but it can be very difficult especially when you get stuck on an obscure person to describe.

For one thing there are less question cards, so you run the risk of starting to repeat much sooner (or have to buy top-up question packs). And although older versions of the game had the tendency to run on a bit, this version has the accelerating factor of fast-track wedge spaces. Regrettably it goes too far the other way and is now really too fast.Finally, I\'d be really clear that this definitely isn\'t a family game. The manufacturers recommend 15 and up, which is a definite minimum, and I\'d say many 15- and 16- year olds would find quite a challenge in the game. | Badly Dumbed-Down Version Of A Classic',2,2199,'2006-05-30'),(9518,'195bfeb5e791dd39704d00396a1c0256',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(9519,'511386180ae8e73dd753095e021be730',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(9520,'b57ccbb51bd2994645aa389d00db4115',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(9521,'d7409c6bdd42535a3040ddb2b6ed4f19',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(9522,'562576573d5f106986c1299c06bdae75',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(9523,'c83f0be601eee3bb4ced71c72abc8a8e',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(9524,'7ac1fb14880a62e65a3aec69d980158f',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(9525,'f514b2d3e794601db64d63c8586b55e6',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(9526,'0fa7a8f74c2a577c9264319a6c561b67',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(9527,'949448bb800311c61492d5d1571e1fb6',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(9528,'b49c7c961069ab87f9e1b66455a5935d',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(9529,'622a7655795b749971e1df35154d0afe','Dexter bobble head // 5.0 // 3 Jan. 2012 // By\n    \n    marie\n  \n on 3 Jan. 2012 // This toy was a gift for a Dexter fan and he loves it - it was not cheap but it is well made and reflects the cost.Ideal gift for a Dexter fan! | Perfect // 5.0 // 9 Aug. 2014 // By\n    \n    Jade McKinnell\n  \n on 9 Aug. 2014 // Fantastic gift for my mams birthday :) | Nice // 5.0 // 3 Oct. 2014 // By\n    \n    Joao Escovar\n  \n on 3 Oct. 2014 // Nice product good value for money | Five Stars // 5.0 // 28 Nov. 2015 // By\n    \n    E.

OK, its no marine or alien, but I am delighted to have a Bishop figure.The figure is mostly excellent, nearly perfect. The sculpt is flawless, I cant find any flaws in it. His jumpsuit, wrist watch and trainers are so well painted and detailed - NECA really are my favourite figure company.The articulation is awkward. NECA seemed focused on hiding his articulation, which helps the sculpt, but limits display possibilities.His accessories are also very good. He comes with a torch, a knife and an interchangeable hand to hold the knife.Why not five stars? The sloppy paint on the head takes away from the PERFECT sculpt. It really is a shame.Sloppy hairline, wonky eyeball and dodgy nostrils!

Full marks to the sculptor for this - it\'s a truly UNCANNY likeness of the legend that is Arnold Schwarzenegger. I\'ve been anticipating this figure for months and months. My expectations were pretty high as I own the Neca quarter scale classic predator, which is a VERY hard act to follow... When I saw the final prototype pictures of Dutch I knew I had to get it pre-ordered! I can happily say that finally, figure in hand it does not disappoint! The sculpt and paint apps are nothing short of exceptional, especially for a figure this size (18\" approx) and (relatively) cheap price. The quarter scale Predator line Neca have been making in recent years have really raised the bar in terms of value for money collectibles.The skin is shaded perfectly and has a wet look to it, which really captures the humidity of the jungle. The details on the clothing and accessories is really very nice. There is absolutely no mistaking who the figure is - it is Arnold through and through! There is also a good amount of articulation in the figure, despite it\'s size although I do offer a word of warning when posing Dutch...I have a few of the Neca quarter scale figures (Alien, Terminator, classic Pred etc.) and have found some stand up a lot better than others.... and some, like the Alien in particular are VERY prone to falling over if you\'re not super careful with balancing the figure when posing. I\'ve had the Dutch figure two days and already 3 times, in a very \'standard\' leg stance the figure has stood fine for a while and then taken a dive randomly hours later... not good if it\'s on a high shelf or hits a hard surface!Read more › | Ankle joints!! why Neca why? // 3.0 // 7 Dec. 2014 // By\n    \n    ednun pourtahmasbi\n  \n on 7 Dec. 2014 // I hate to give this 3 stars because the sculpt and accessories are really top quality but... Neca, when will you ever learn? loose ankle joints combined with heavy figures mean shelf dives. I really wish they would forget the ankle joints as they are so poorly implemented and just go for dynamic poses instead. I know that is not a popular view, but I have had Dutch, Robocop and Predator all fall off a 6.5 foot shelf now and let me tell you, 3 kkilos of heavy plastic figure falling towards you is not something you want to experience more than once in your lifetime. He\'s a great figure, looks fantastic fighting my classic 18 inch Predator, but for goodness sake make double and tripple sure he\'s posed stably before you leave him alone. My personal advice would be to leave the  assault rifle off him until he\'s proven he can stand up, in the hot summer for at least 3 weeks without any shelf diving. | Received the item in perfect condition!

It took me a while to grasp the idea but when I got the hang of it i had so much fun. Unfortunately, my sister managed to drop it and one of the lines of pegs snapped. I was cross with her but fixed it with some Blu-Tac as super glue didn\'t seem to work. I still can use the  loom however when I use the loom, depending on the number of bands on each peg, the lines of pegs seem to lift of of the plates holding the lines of pegs together warping and sometime making the bands come off of the pegs so I have to start again. I\'m sure that if my sister hadn\'t of dropped it, it would\'ve been fine. Also the hook is made of a very thin plastic which warped easily, so now i have to use a crochet hook.

I am therefore always on the look out for new ideas and projects for her. As she also loves dinosaurs I knew she would absolutely love this kit- especially as we have had other Melissa and Doug kits which she has enjoyed. In this kit you get two different model dinosaurs, a paint brush and different coloured paints. I especially like that the dinosaur models are very robust and well made- and have coped very well when they have been accidentally dropped by our three year old with no damage despite being dropped from a couple of feet from her table onto our laminate floor.The other thing I really like about this kit is that there is plenty of paint- as young children do tend to be a little heavy handed with materials this is always a plus. This is a really well kit that my daughter has loved so much so that we brought a second set-  she now has a collection of 4 beautifully painted dinosaurs which she is very proud of. | Nice present but smaller than I thought.',4,942,'2014-05-12'),(9712,'f4528ccd5820de75161b65ece7432e93','can not comment on quality of bands but looks good & the charms that come with it look fab // 5.0 // 2 Oct. 2014 // By\n    \n    LouiseD\n  \n on 2 Oct. 2014 // Bought as a gift for a 4yr old girl who had previously learned how to make loom bands, can not comment on quality of bands but looks good & the charms that come with it look fab. comes with everything you need as a stand alone set as far as I can tell | Good // 4.0 // 29 Dec. 2014 // By\n    \n    Courtney Marie\n  \n on 29 Dec. 2014 // The young girl who received them loved them and has not stopped using them.

Such a simple idea, but beautifully executed.The dice are nicely heavy in the hand: children really want to roll them. The storage box is also superb quality: you know that it\'ll last you for a long time.I\'ve used these dice (and the other two sets available) in the classroom to inspire story telling and with my own children to occupy them on journeys. Sets can be shared across a class, with each group/table having different ones, or use a visualiser to show the same dice to the whole class. They will each interpret the pictures in their own way. Simply superb for shared writing or poetry. Think of something for each letter of the alphabet that fits the rolled image(s) or tell a story as a random die is chosen and rolled, or add another item to the list that gets ever longer ...Lovely dice, with countless uses :-) | \'Simple Fun To Spark Your Imagination\' // 5.0 // 10 Dec. 2012 // By\n    \n    Antony May\n  \nTOP 1000 REVIEWER on 10 Dec. 2012 // As is usually the case with games, the most simple ideas are often the best. How much easier to play could a game be than picking up a handful of \'story cube\' dice throwing them on the table and then, letting your imagination be guided by the combination of random images your throw has provided, either writing or telling a story beginning with \'Once Upon A Time\'?Rory\'s Story Cubes are not only educational, fun, and challenging they are perfect for parties when late in the hour the dancing has ceased and people are chatting around a table with a glass of wine. Writing clubs will also find them an invaluable tool for inspiring great works from members at workshops and the best thing about them is that there are millions of possible combinations so no two workshops will ever be the same!The cubes come in a really tough little box with a magnetic fastener (nice touch!). They are of good quality manufacture and even repeated use is unlikely to cause any of the print to come off unlike many other cheap dice games.Add to the fun the fact that other \'themed\' sets (\'Actions\' & A \'Random\' set\') of \'Story Cubes\' are also available and can be \'mixed & matched\' together in any combination you choose and you have a simple game with endless twists and turns that will keep you and your friends amused until the end of time!These \'Voyages\' dice are especially great for combining with the \'Random\' set and parents of small kids needing inspiration for the latest installment of their current \'bedtime story\' will find them invaluable!Charming, enchanting and with the ability to re-awaken the kid in even the oldest adult.Essential. | Amazing // 5.0 // 19 Feb. 2013 // By\n    \n    Ian S\n  \n on 19 Feb. 2013 // I brought this product for my 6 year old son because he is a lazy reader! Very capable but lazy! I also brought the other ranges. When they arrived we sat down as a family and played lots of story telling with them - It was hilarious and even my 5 year old girl loved it. It really opened up his imagination! So much so that recently his story was shortlisted to receive an award and our local Festival of Literature! He didnt win but we keep playing with the cubes!!! Definate buy for all children! | Stimulates imagination, many hours of enjoyment, compact, lightweight, durable, lovely presentation box, highly recommend! // 5.0 // 31 Jan. 2016 // By\n    \n    Clairy Fairy 17\n  \nTOP 1000 REVIEWER on 31 Jan. 2016 // Overview: These are a set of cubes which show a different image on each face. The aim of these are for the children to roll them and put them in order to make a sequence ready for a story. The child is then to use their imagination to create a story based on those characters, props and themes.The images include: camera, helmet, backpack, musical note, crab, map, treasure chest, axe, beans, snake, monkey, trophy, man, elephant, mushroom, cogs, bib, tent, cactus, cauldron, octopus, glasses, crow, waves, test tube etc.Uses: These are a fantastic resource to use in the classroom or at home. They come in a variety of styles which will suit different topics and children\'s interests. In the classroom they can be used individually with children or they could be used as a whole group with each child having a different image to add to the whole class story (e.g. sit in a circle and try to add a sequence to the running story). At home, or in the car journey they can be used to keep children amused and stimulated throughout.They are:> Compact, lightweight and durable.> Come in a lovely presentation box to keep them safe!> Have a different image on each face e.g a character, prop or themes/ideas.> Have a variety of themes to choose from e.g. other imagination ones and a new batman one has just been released.Would highly recommend to anyone who has children or works with them! They are fab!!!! Many hours of enjoymentActivity ideas:> Could be used to help develop EAL learners language recall. This may include rolling a dice and the children in the small EAL group need to say the key word as quick as possible. The first child to say it wins a point.Read more › | Good fun!',4,291,'2013-07-28'),(9790,'73e3b7bcf3c3d5829e64e6679335f2b8',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(9791,'b901f78333c472078401861fe7de40c2','Nice product',5,190,'2015-07-08'),(9792,'a1172b930e59ac341cb55cac8e547497',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(9793,'f2f6271bd523d7b1d8704b6141ea44ad',NULL,NULL,1,NULL),(9794,'4ffba4e5416ddca4dfafd47e96e7972e','Bad experience // 3.0 // 12 Nov. 2013 // By\n    \n    Rozina\n  \n on 12 Nov. 2013 // Only received the snakes and ladders game.

The tools of the gaming trade. The relationship between a gamer and their dice can be a strange, unfathomable one. Will these dice reach the mark to be slipped into my dice bag? Lets see...Form Factor: My dice are purple with white ink. The plastic has a quartz-style finish which I find very appealing. The inking is clear and easy to read at a distance. Indeed, the font doesn\'t appear to be the bog standard dice font on everything but the d6 and as a result the clarity is maybe a little better than usual. The size of the writing has been maximised on each die, and again, this adds to the clarity. It is a really nice touch. 6s and 9s have orientation indicators, as it should be, and the set includes a d10 and a d00 ten-sider.Performance: Have I put these dice through an exhaustive battery of tests to ensure their numeric distribution? No. I did what any other gamer would do and took them for a ride in a game. I\'m pleased to announce that they didn\'t disgrace me. The d20 was not taken outside and introduced to Andy the Angle Grinder. All was well.In conclusion, Paladin appear to have tried to tweak, every-so-slightly, the standard dice design and it works well. Good dice.

It uses a set of hexagonal tiles, each with line fragments of three of the four possible colours. If you place the tiles right and plan the order you place them in, you are able to make forced moves to create ever-longer lines. The winner is the person with the single longest continuous line at the end of the game. If you manage to close the line to make a loop, you score double, so you have to be careful to watch what your opponent is doing.Every tile is unique, so you have to watch which tiles have been played and therefore work out what is still to come and whether you will be able to find the tiles you need.This is essentially an extremely simple game with very few rules, so may be learnt by even young children. Like all great games, though, real skill is needed to play at the very highest level. If you can\'t find a person to play with you face to face, you can visit the tantrix.com website and play against both robots and other people.As a solitaire, it is a great 2D spatial challenge.It\'s one of the few strategy type games of this sort that I have played over a number of years and still find absorbing. | Addictive fun for the whole family // 4.0 // 23 Feb. 2005 // By\n    \n    M.

I did a bit of research and decided to buy this double 12 set based on the largely positive previous reviews and predominantly intended to use them to play Mexican train (hence the accessories). Everything was present (inc. the plastic station hub and 4 train markers) and the dominoes were complete and shrink-wrapped. However, a couple of dominoes have chips / damage to the back and quite a number appear to be of a slightly different colour (more ivory rather than off-white). A couple are also slightly thicker / thinner than the majority and a few have slightly poor paint spots (although this is just cosmetic). At the end of the day, I did not expect perfect tournament quality dominoes, so I can live with imperfections on the faces, but I am not happy about the ability to potentially identify dominoes due to the damage, colour, marks or size discrepancies.

Holmes\n  \n on 14 Oct. 2009 // Having collected a few original SW figures over the years (including a 1977 Darth Vader my parents found in a pond!) but having had to give up due to unemployment etc, I thought i\'d get back into it with this classic figure. Biggs Darklighter is a name well known to Star Wars fans-he is a friend of Lukes on Tatooine who joins the Imperial Academy and then defects to the Rebellion. He participated in the Rebel assault on the first Death Star, where he was killed by Darth Vader in the famous \'trench run\' sequence. This figure has all the right bits in the right places, from the shiny black leather on the boots and gloves to the cut of the flight suit. The detailing on the helmet and life-support gear is exceptional, with Biggs\' helmet art faithfully recreated in minature. All in all a wonderful piece for the collector...and maybe the kids too!I have just two minor niggles...the first being the pose-which, if you match all the lines up, \'locks\' him into that position and no other (he also looks a tad \'camp\' when viewed from certain angles!), and the second being his pistol-if you take the gummy band off to remove it, you WILL lose it. It is so small and delicate that it\'s best to touch it as little as possible.Other than those small gripes it\'s a very well made figure and stays faithful to both the story and the character. | \"They\'ll never stop us!\"',5,2250,'2007-04-14'),(9963,'b11990bb904deecae1f105450c77ddcc','Amazing sword but too big for Thorin the dwarf! // 5.0 // 17 Feb. 2014 // By\n    \n    John\n  \n on 17 Feb. 2014 // I can\'t describe my enthusiasm when I opened the package.

The blade is crafted from stainless steel but not sharp - it\'s a decorative sword - (You can check if is stainless steel by dropping water. The water doesn\'t stay it slides away.).The handle it\'s not wooden but metallic but believe me if you do not touch it you will not realize it.

Kahs\n  \n on 19 Nov. 2015 // As an avid collector of replica Lord of the Rings blades, I was eager to add this sword to my collection.All my other pieces are United Cutlery, anyone who has held one of their blades knows the high quality to which they are manufactured. This was my first time visiting the Noble Collection and sadly it will be my last.I appreciate this product has at present, eighteen 5 star reviews and I hate being the first to ruin that, but I have to be honest in my review.I was initially impressed with the sword, the scale is spot on, the weight is reassuring, it\'s actually very heavy given it\'s size. The Elvish scroll on the blade is beautiful and the handle as others have commented isn\'t wood, but feels great to hold. It was a dull afternoon when it arrived so when I turned on some bright lights to really appreciate it, that\'s where disappointment set in.I have six other officially licenced LOTR replica swords, so the expectation was high, but the quality of the blade really let me down. The blade was dull, had a less than subtle brush like pattern along its whole length and small black marks that were hard to miss.A faint brown smudge at the widest point of the blade and I was wrapping it back up to be returned. A Made in China sticker didn\'t help improve my confidence.I can\'t even review the stand, I never looked at it.The seller was great and my refund is on the way, I can\'t fault them in anyway. Maybe I\'m to picky for my own good, but when I spend that sort of money on a replica, that so many had raved about (Including a walk in store that had sung it\'s praises) I expect much better. | Amazing, Great quality item! // 5.0 // 19 Dec. 2012 // By\n    \n    honestreviews\n  \n on 19 Dec. 2012 // Truely stunning, Great quality, Better than I expected!The actor who uses this in the film said it was heavy...
